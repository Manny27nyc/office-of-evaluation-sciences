A recent review of OES projects completed between 2015-2018 found that the OES <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/blog/meta-analysis-part-1/">behaviorally-informed interventions had a small but significant impact</a>. This exciting result left us wondering: what did it cost to deliver these interventions? And how do these costs help us interpret the impact findings? To supplement the large scale review, OES analyzed high level cost categories for the OES projects included in the review. 

### What did it cost to deliver these effective interventions?

Nearly a quarter of OES interventions implemented between 2015-2018 represented no additional ongoing marginal cost. A vast majority of projects - 87% - were of no, very low or low marginal cost to deliver. This assessment was based on data about the distribution approach for each intervention and assumptions about the relative cost of these various distribution types.

One example of an opportunity for applying behavioral insights at no additional ongoing cost is the introduction of prompts to guide users in an online system, as prompts are shown to improve accuracy and reduce error. In 2015, <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/projects/iff-reporting-errors/">OES designed an electronic signature box</a> for GSA’s online sales reporting portal. As a result of this change- which was no ongoing cost for the agency- portal users more accurately reported sales; the median self-reported sales amount was $445 higher for vendors using the behaviorally informed signature prompt, translating into an extra $1.59 million paid to the government in one single quarter. Behavioral insights can similarly be applied to redesign existing physical letters, postcards, and emails. 
For the portfolio of OES projects implemented between 2015-2018, behavioral insights was more often applied by introduction of a new intervention; a mailing campaign is added, a reminder text is introduced, etc. While these projects introduced an ongoing variable cost, these were generally quite small because the staff time and distribution costs associated with such activities are low. 
 
### How do these costs help us interpret the impact findings? 

Paired with the impact findings - average improvement of 8.1% on key policy outcomes - this suggests that OES interventions in 2015-2018 generally yielded statistically significant improvements at no-to-low ongoing marginal cost. While OES did not conduct a robust cost-effectiveness analysis, which would require detailed implementation and delivery cost data, this characteristic-based-costing suggests a promising return on investment for agencies adopting behavioral insights.  

### What’s next? 

Understanding when and how to apply behavioral insights within government is of paramount importance. OES has <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/assets/abstracts/OES%20Learnings%20on%20Writing%20Better%20Communications%202018.pdf">key recommendations and findings</a> from its experience incorporating and testing behavioral insights in over 50 different government communications. OES will continue to share what we learn in applying, testing, and costing behavioral interventions. In addition to generating insights, OES will support the take-up of such evidence across government partners.
Moving forward, OES is building evidence on a broader range of programs across government. Recognizing more complex or expensive interventions can still be cost effective, OES aims to build evidence on impact and identify cost effective program improvements across government..
