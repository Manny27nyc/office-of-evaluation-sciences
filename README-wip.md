Hello! This branch represents some work in progress on refreshing the OES site. For the rest of the work they need done, the main blocker is the super out-of-date version of the uswds-jekyll theme the site is on. I didn't want to build a ton of new templates for them on v1 of the USWDS (it's not even a particularly recent v1 release) since that would just make it that much harder to upgrade the theme which is also something the OES team wants to do. There's a lot of work being done on the jekyll theme which should be done soon-ish.

It could also use some more attention to the design. The OES team would like the look updated a bit in addition to the new content & functionality. All I've done so far design-wise it replace some of the main USWDS colors with some from the OES palette.

The OES team wanted the team page to show team members in a modal popup, and that's mostly built. It could use some styling for mobile though.
