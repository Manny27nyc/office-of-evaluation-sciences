## What was the challenge?

Improper payments include payments made by the government to the wrong person or in the wrong amount. Ensuring payment integrity by reducing improper payments is a top priority for the Federal government, to make certain that taxpayer money is serving its intended purpose.

## What did we do?

At the request of the Office of Federal Financial Management, a component of the Office of Management and Budget, OES developed a guide that allows agencies to become better acquainted with ways to apply behavioral insights to reduce improper payments in their programs. This guide builds on work such as a Behavioral Insights Toolkit created by the Internal Revenue Service, which describes ways to integrate a behavioral insights approach into tax administration. 

## What did we learn?

The behavioral insights guide created by OES aims to help government employees assess whether a behavioral insights approach is a good fit for their program, identify which interventions are appropriate, and implement those interventions with the goal of reducing improper payments.  OES team members are available for discussions with agencies and can provide advice about applying the ideas in the playbook.
