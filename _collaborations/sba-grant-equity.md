## What was the challenge?

The Small Business Administration (SBA) has strategic goals to support small business revenue and job growth and to restore small businesses and communities after disasters. One such disaster has been the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which caused unprecedented disruption to small businesses. Even in a healthy economy, racial and ethnic minorities, women, and veterans have more difficulty obtaining working capital to open and sustain small businesses, and SBA supports strategies that make it easier for these groups to access funding. Relief funding to support small businesses totaled over $700 billion by August 2020. But numerous challenges limited access to emergency resources for minority and women owned businesses and there are early indications of increased rates of closure for minority-owned businesses. 

In addition to federal efforts, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act signed on March 27, 2020 also allocated $5 billion for state and local communities to spend on activities including small business assistance. Local governments designed their own disbursement programs and made their own decisions about which groups to target for assistance and how to reach them. The Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) documented the approaches local governments took in disbursing funding, the common challenges encountered by officials and applicants, and how these relate to SBAâ€™s access goals. This  work identifies where further evidence is needed to get working capital to small businesses who need it, particularly under time constraints. 

## What did we do?

OES conducted a descriptive study of local grant and loan programs. Information was gathered from eight local governments, which had diverse demographics in terms of population size, median household income, income variation, and racial and ethnic populations. These local governments offered different types of small business support during COVID-19, ranging from $7,500 or $10,000 grants, to no-interest or forgivable (i.e., some or all of the balance does not need to be repaid if the borrower meets certain conditions) loans up to $15,000,  to low-interest loans of up to $50,000. Four data sources were used: publicly available information about funding programs, tailored conversations with local officials following up on specific program elements, social media to capture perspectives of applicants and observers, and analysis of previously published research. 

## What did we learn?

**Many local governments attempted to address access for business owners from historically underserved groups, but each took a different approach.**  Some local governments did not try to target any particular groups, but simply to distribute money quickly to eligible businesses. Others did have goals about making allocations **equitable**, but this meant different things in different places. Some local governments focused on disbursing funding equitably across geographic areas; others targeted businesses owned by women or specific racial or ethnic groups; some had specific numeric targets. 

There were three basic models for distributing grants and loans. Some funds were distributed on a first-come, first-served basis after verifying eligibility; other programs used a lottery to randomly select recipients from a pool of verified applicants; others assigned points based on criteria and awarded funds to applicants with the highest scores. The following Comparison of Program Models shows some of the tradeoffs between the different models adopted by local governments.
