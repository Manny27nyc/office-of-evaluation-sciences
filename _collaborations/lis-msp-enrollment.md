summary: Revising letters to individuals who may be eligible for the Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy and Medicare Savings Program

## What was the challenge?

Participation levels for the Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy (LIS or “Extra Help”) and Medicare Savings Programs (MSP) are estimated to be lower than the number of eligible individuals. A 2010 report, for instance, estimated that as many as 2.3 million Medicare beneficiaries who may be eligible for LIS are not receiving the benefit. In May of each year, the Social Security Administration (SSA) mails out the “Social Security LIS and MSP Outreach Notice” to individuals who may be eligible for both the Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs) and Extra Help (Form L448), or those who may be eligible only for the MSPs (Form L447), to inform them of the benefits and how to apply.

## What did we do?

OES partnered with SSA to re-design the L448 and L447 letters in an effort to increase LIS and MSP enrollment. The redesigned letters made potential savings salient, made the letters personal by clarifying how eligibility depends on the recipient’s own income and asset limits, and summarized the takeaways in clear language and easy-to-digest tables. 

The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/interventions/Intervention Pack - LIS and MSP Enrollment.pdf">Intervention Pack</a> shows the original and redesigned letters, and highlights the best practices adopted in the re-design for effective communications.

## What did we learn?

Starting in May 2017, SSA mailed the letters to over 2 million individuals whose data suggested they may be eligible for the benefits. We do not have data on changes in enrollment following implementation of the redesigned letters.
