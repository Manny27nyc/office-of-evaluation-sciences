summary: Revising letters to individuals who may be eligible for the Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy and Medicare Savings Program

## What was the challenge?

Tens of millions of Americans choose health insurance coverage within federal programs that offer a selection of private plans, including the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy (LIS or “Extra Health”) beneficiaries who previously chose a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan on their own and face increased premiums in the future qualify to pay a $0 premium if they switch to a different plan. However, beneficiaries must actively “opt in” to choose to switch plans. We know from the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/124/4/1639/1917201">behavioral science literature</a> that, unless otherwise prompted, individuals often stick to the default rather than make an explicit, opt-in choice, even if the default is not the best option for them. 

## What did we do?

OES partnered with SSA to re-design the L448 and L447 letters in an effort to increase LIS and MSP enrollment. The redesigned letters made potential savings salient, made the letters personal by clarifying how eligibility depends on the recipient’s own income and asset limits, and summarized the takeaways in clear language and easy-to-digest tables. 

The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/interventions/Intervention Pack - LIS and MSP Enrollment.pdf">Intervention Pack</a> shows the original and redesigned letters, and highlights the best practices adopted in the re-design for effective communications.

## What did we learn?

Starting in May 2017, SSA mailed the letters to over 2 million individuals whose data suggested they may be eligible for the benefits. We do not have data on changes in enrollment following implementation of the redesigned letters.
