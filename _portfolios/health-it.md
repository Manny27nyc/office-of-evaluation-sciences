## Background

Health information technology (“health IT”), refers to the technologies and tools that allow health care professionals and patients to store, share, and analyze health information.

To aid in efforts to improve health IT adoption and use by patients and providers, the Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) has completed several rigorous evaluations to learn what works.
