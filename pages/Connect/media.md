## Academic Publications

Jacob Goldin, Tatiana Homonoff, and William Tucker-Ray. <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20171059">“Retirement contribution rate nudges and plan participation: evidence from a field experiment,”</a> American Economic Review 107, no. 5 (2017): 456-461. 	
- This field experiment analyzes how short messages can increase retirement savings by U.S. military service-members. The study finds that service-members who received a message emphasizing a low contribution rate were more likely to participate in a savings plan than were. service-members whose message emphasized a high contribution rate, or no rate at all. 

Jake Bowers, Nathaniel Higgins, Dean Karlan, Sarah Tulman, and Jonathan Zinman. <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20171060">“Challenges to replication and iteration in field experiments: evidence from two direct mail shots,”</a> American Economic Review 107, no. 5: (2017): 462-465. 	
- This study conducted field experiments to analyze the effect of two direct mailing techniques on enrollment rates in microloans to farmers. The study found that while borrowing from a government program increased the first year, the direct effect did not replicate in the second year, thus lowering the likelihood of information spillover. 

Adam Sacarny, David Yokum, and Shantanu Agrawal. <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20171061">“Government-academic partnerships in randomized evaluations: the case of inappropriate prescribing,”</a> American Economic Review 107, no. 5, (2017): 466-470.	
- This study conducted several randomized letter interventions targeting high-volume prescribers of drugs that can harm patients. It utilized a continuous improvement approach that rapidly evaluates each round and uses the results to inform subsequent work.

U.S. Department of Agriculture. Economic Research Service. USDA Microloans for Farmers: Participation Patterns and Effects of Outreach, by Sarah Tulman, Nathaniel Higgins, Robert Williams, Michael Gerling, Charles Dodson, and Bruce McWilliams. Economic Research Report No. (ERR-222). Washington DC: USDA, 2016. <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=81870">ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=81870</a> (accessed May 16, 2019)	
- U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency’s (FSA) Microloan program, launched in 2013, aims to better serve the credit needs of several types of farmers: small, beginning, veteran, and/or from historically socially disadvantaged groups (women and minorities). ERS researchers investigate the composition of Microloan borrowers and the receipt of these loans by new FSA borrowers.

John Guyton, Dayanand S. Manoli, Brenda Scafer, and Michael Sebastiani. <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w21904">“Reminders & recidivism: evidence from tax filing & EITC participation among low-income nonfilers,”</a> National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc. NBER Working Paper no. 21904, (2016)	
- This project examines how reminders affect tax filing among lower-income nonfilers (individuals who did not appear on a filed tax return but had income reported by third parties to the Internal Revenue Service). The results demonstrate that one-time and follow-up reminders increase tax filing, although this effect does not persist with individuals who owe a balance.

Adam Sacarny, David Yokum, Amy Finkelstein, and Shantanu Arawal. <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1025">“Medicare letters to curb overprescribing of controlled substances had no detectable effect on providers.”</a> Health Affairs 35 no. 3 (2017): 471-479. 
- This study used a randomized controlled trial approach to evaluate a low-cost, light-touch intervention aimed at reducing the inappropriate provision of Schedule II controlled substances in the Medicare Part D Program. 

Adam Sacarny, Michael L. Barnett, and Jackson Le. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30073273/">“Effect of peer comparison letters for high-volume primary care prescribers of quetiapine in older and disabled adults: a randomized clinical trial.”</a> JAMA Psychiatry 75 no. 10 (October 2018): 1003-1011.	
- In this randomized clinical trial, a peer comparison letter randomized across the 5055 highest Medicare prescribers of the antipsychotic quetiapine fumarate reduced prescribing for at least 2 years. Effects were larger than those observed in existing large-scale behavioral interventions, potentially because of the content of the peer comparison letter, which mentioned the potential for a review of prescribing activity.

David Yokum, Julie C. Lauffenburger, Roya Ghazinouri, and Niteesh K. Choudhry. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0432-2">“Letters designed with behavioural science increase influenza vaccination in Medicare beneficiaries.”</a> Nature Human Behaviour 2 (2018): 743–749	
- This study used a randomized controlled trial approach to evaluate a low-cost, light-touch intervention aimed at reducing the inappropriate provision of Schedule II controlled substances in the Medicare Part D Program. 

Adam Sacarny, Michael L. Barnett, and Shantanu Agrawal. “New Evidence on Stemming Low-Value Prescribing.” NEJM Catalyst, April 10, 2019, <a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/new-evidence-stemming-overprescribing/">catalyst.nejm.org/new-evidence-stemming-overprescribing/</a>
- This article examines the effect that different types of messaging  can have on reducing overprescribing.

Amira Choueiki. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.12594">“Behavioral insights for better implementation in government.”</a> Public Administration Review 76, no. 4 (June 2016).	 
- This article discusses the behavioral insights learned and successful interventions implemented from the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team one year after its establishment.

- This collaboration between OES and the Louisiana Department of Health Immunization Program evaluated the effect of sending a postcard reminder on elderly vaccination rates. This study showed that a postcard reminder can encourage the elderly to vaccinate, and that the timing of that reminder matters.

Jessica Leight and Elana Safran. <a href="https://journal-bpa.org/index.php/jbpa/article/view/55">"Increasing immunization compliance among schools and day care centers: Evidence from a randomized controlled trial."</a> Journal of Behavioral Public Administration 2, no. 2 (2019)	
- This paper reports on the results of a randomized controlled trial in which researchers collaborated with a department of health in a mid-size city to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted communications highlighting descriptive social norms to increase immunization compliance across 700 schools.

Adam Sacarny, Andrew R. Olenski, and Michael L. Barnett. “Association of Quetiapine Overuse Letters With Prescribing by Physician Peers of Targeted Recipients: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.” JAMA Psychiatry, June 4, 2019, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2735441?resultClick=1">jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2735441</a>
- A randomized clinical trial of antipsychotic overuse letters that were sent by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to high prescribers of quetiapine reduced prescribing by targeted physicians by 16% over 2 years. This study examines whether these letters led to changes in prescribing by peers of the original physicians, which would suggest that overuse interventions can have broader effects.
