## What is the impact of applying behavioral insights in government? 
## Discussion of positive findings from a recent large-scale review
Join OES in a discussion of the impact of behavioral insights in government. UC Berkeley’s Elizabeth Linos will present their findings from a massive review of behavioral interventions in federal and local government. Members of the Office of Evaluation Sciences and the Behavioral Insights Team, along with federal experts, will share reactions and offer thoughts on next steps. 

The recent paper “RCTs to Scale: Comprehensive Evidence from Two Nudge Units” analyzes how effective behaviorally informed interventions were in 126 trials across many policy areas and involving 24 million people. The researchers found an overall effect of these interventions to be statistically significant and positive at 1.4 percentage points, which translates to a relative increase of 8.1% on priority program and policy outcomes.  Notably, 87% of the OES interventions analyzed were of no marginal cost or low cost, suggesting  that applying behavioral insights can be very cost effective. 

In addition to discussing the findings in detail, the conversation will underline the value of sharing all results — positive, negative and null — so that we are able to get a clearer and more accurate picture of impacts, and offer guidance to help us design better interventions and evaluations in the future and help give a more realistic picture of possible impacts and outcomes. 
- Friday, December 18 from 12:00-1:00PM EST via Zoom. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd77_FWmvQwsoZkkEYM1pVAWRDet-KNSGMsyIUc1y9gVDoMrA/viewform">RSVP here</a>.

# Past OES Events 
### <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/2019annualevent">Using Evidence: Learning from Low-Cost Federal Evidence Building Activities</a>
The U.S. General Services Administration’s (GSA) Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) and numerous agency collaborators presented on how the federal government uses low-cost evaluations, unexpected results, and administrative data to inform policy and program decisions. OES staff, collaborators from multiple agencies, and distinguished academic partners presented new results and lessons learned from over 10 OES evaluations in three sessions: Learning from Low-Cost Evaluations, Learning from Unexpected Results, and Learning from Administrative Data. All sessions included information and examples relevant to meeting the requirements of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act)
