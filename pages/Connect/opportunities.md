### OES Annual Fellowship Overview
OES accepts applications annually for one-year fellowships beginning in the fall in Washington, D.C. Based at the General Services Administration (GSA), <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/team/">OES is a team of interdisciplinary experts</a> that works across government to help agencies build and use evidence. 

Team members work alongside agency collaborators to apply behavioral insights, make concrete recommendations on how to improve government, and evaluate impact using administrative data. OES is uniquely situated at the center of government to share leading practices, develop resources and build skills in the Federal workforce on evidence and evaluation. To date, OES has completed over <a href="http://oes.gsa.gov/work">70 randomized evaluations</a> with dozens of agency partners. OES follows the best practices in social science research to build evidence in order to be a <a href="http://oes.gsa.gov/methods">leader in transparency and accountability.</a> OES forms innovative partnerships to tackle some of the most pressing challenges in the United States and abroad, such as  opioid prescribing, access to healthcare for Veterans, reducing energy use and costs, and improving government efficiency. 

Fellows and Associate Fellows join OES on-loan from academic, nonprofit, or government offices on either a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis. Fellows have come from a variety of universities, non-profits, and Federal departments. There is additional flexibility for Federal employees applying for a rotational detail.
