## Partnering with OES

We’re excited to partner with agency collaborators across government. OES team members work alongside agency collaborators to apply behavioral insights, make concrete recommendations on how to improve government, and evaluate impact using administrative data. OES is also uniquely situated at the center of government to share leading practices, develop resources, and build skills in the Federal workforce on evidence and evaluation. 

 Send us your ideas on how we might work together, whether you’re interested in partnering on: 
   - An evaluation
   - A training
   - Resources
   - Or something else

Send us information on the question you are trying to answer, outcome you are trying to improve or the resources you may need to <a href="mailto:oes@gsa.gov?subject=Partnering with OES: Project Idea">oes@gsa.gov</a> to start the conversation. We do not have the ability to respond to all partnership proposals, but we consider each opportunity carefully. We look forward to hearing from you!

## Supporting OES as an Academic Affiliate 

We often require specific subject matter expertise as we identify opportunities to work with agencies on an ongoing basis. As an Academic Affiliate, you will be able to apply your work to improve government, and have the opportunity to publish results. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqnuRSZNKZt9bVLAGw6G64i5oUNDqsGcrX7dvgGpvlac9Cog/viewform?usp=sf_link">Tell us about your area of expertise</a>, and we may reach out to you to collaborate on a specific project.
