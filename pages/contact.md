## OES Annual Recruitment 
OES accepts applications annually for one-year fellowships beginning in the fall in Washington, D.C. Based at the General Services Administration (GSA), OES is a team of interdisciplinary experts that works across government to help agencies build and use evidence. 

Team members work alongside agency collaborators to apply behavioral insights, make concrete recommendations on how to improve government, and evaluate impact using administrative data. OES is uniquely situated at the center of government to share leading practices, develop resources and build skills in the Federal workforce on evidence and evaluation. To date, OES has completed over 70 randomized evaluations with dozens of agency partners. OES follows the best practices in social science research to build evidence in order to be a leader in transparency and accountability. OES forms innovative partnerships to tackle some of the most pressing challenges in the United States and abroad, such as  opioid prescribing, access to healthcare for Veterans, reducing energy use and costs, and improving government efficiency. 

Fellows and Associate Fellows join OES on-loan from academic, nonprofit, or government offices on either a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis. Fellows have come from a variety of universities, non-profits, and Federal departments. There is additional flexibility for Federal employees applying for a rotational detail. You can learn more about the position and what we look for by [viewing the 2020 Fellowship Solicitation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/GSA_OES_SolicitationFY20.pdf). 
            
      
## Partnering with OES

We’re excited to partner with new agency collaborators across government. What makes an opportunity a good fit for testing an evidence-based insight with OES?

- A clear touchpoint between the Federal government and an individual
- An outcome of interest that depends in part on people’s actions 
- An outcome of interest that is reflected in existing administrative data (or could be easily collected) 
- A program population size that is large enough to be statistically and policy relevant
- The ability to randomly assign groups of people to different versions of a program change 
- An agency collaborator willing to work alongside OES and to share results across government

Send a description of how your opportunity incorporates the elements above in an email to <a href="mailto:oes@gsa.gov?subject=Project Proposal">oes@gsa.gov</a> to start the conversation. Naturally, we do not have the ability to respond to all project proposals, but we consider each opportunity using the criteria described above, our teams' current makeup of skillsets, and available resources to assess our ability to collaborate.

## Supporting OES as an Academic Affiliate 

We often require specific subject matter expertise as we identify opportunities to work with agencies on an ongoing basis. As an Academic Affiliate, you will be able to apply your work to improve government, and have the opportunity to publish results. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqnuRSZNKZt9bVLAGw6G64i5oUNDqsGcrX7dvgGpvlac9Cog/viewform?usp=sf_link">Tell us about your area of expertise</a>, and we may reach out to you to collaborate on a specific project.
