This Toolkit is meant to support the extensive network of external partners’ Census communication and outreach efforts.

OES and the Veterans Benefits Administration in the Department of Veterans Affairs developed and <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/projects/gi-bill-proactive-communication/">tested a proactive communication</a> to increase college enrollment for Post-9/11 GI Bill beneficiaries. This communication encouraged beneficiaries to enroll full-time and increase their enrollment intensity. It also provided information on accessing financial aid, and connected delays in degree completion with potential monetary impacts. <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/blog/gi-bill-communication/">Read more.</a>

Based on the increase in the amount of wages reported, a cost-benefit analysis suggests that the letters **generated a reduction in overpayments of approximately $9.44 per $1 spent by SSA.** <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/blog/wage-reporting/">Read more.</a>
