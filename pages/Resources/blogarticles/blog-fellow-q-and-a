The OES team had the pleasure of bringing on <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/team/">seven new fellows in 2020</a> from various disciplines - including cost effectiveness, quantitative methods, economics, public administration, marketing, human-centered design, and psychology - to work on different project teams supporting agencies to build and use evidence. Our fellows provide rigorous academic expertise and ensure our projects meet the highest standards of evaluation rigor and research integrity. 
 
As we approach nearly nine months into the COVID-19 pandemic here in Washington D.C., we recognize that this is our first cohort of fellows working with the team entirely remotely. We asked a few of our fellows to reflect on their experiences working with the team this year.

### Why did you join OES?
- *Elizabeth*: As a professor, your incentives are to publish, regardless of whether the work you’re doing is impacting policy. This fellowship provides the opportunity to use academic expertise to generate actionable evidence for policymakers, while at the same time publishing academic articles, and improving government effectiveness.
- *Erin*: The nation wide reach of OES projects has tremendous potential. In particular, building on the foundation laid by the 2018 Evidence Act to shape and deliver on learning agendas across many different government agencies is a unique and momentous opportunity.
Heather: I’ve been interested for a long time in doing research that’s relevant to public policy, but that can be pretty abstract when you’re sitting in a university. The OES Fellowship seemed like a great way to do that kind of work hands-on, and I’m learning a lot that will shape the research and teaching I do after I go back to my university job. Also, after 8 years at the same institution working on a specific set of projects, it’s been really energizing to dive into a fresh set of challenges with a new batch of collaborators.
- *Mattie*: As an academic in the behavioral sciences, I saw this fellowship as an ideal opportunity to execute rigorous evaluations at scale in settings where the findings are immediately relevant and impactful. 
- *Jess:* As a designer, I was very excited to join an interdisciplinary team where I would learn new approaches that I can bring to problem solving and design. I’m dedicated to working on meaningful improvements to government programs and services. OES’ position and reach to partner with various agencies creates unique opportunities to do that.

### What does a usual week look like for a fellow?
- *Elizabeth:* Instead of writing lectures and grading, I’m putting together slide decks for exciting new interventions that have the potential to improve public experiences of government. Similar to my professor duties, I am engaging in project management, including meeting with public servants across the federal government, data analysis, and writing for a variety of audiences including the public, policymakers, and academics.  
- *Erin*: The weekly lab meetings are an energizing opportunity to dive deep into projects across the OES portfolio- providing an opportunity to not only think deeply about technical aspects of projects, but pushing fellows to apply an interdisciplinary and practical lens to all our work.
