In 2017, OES developed the Community Outreach Toolkit with the U.S. Census Bureau in an effort to summarize behavioral insights that agency partners and external research have identified as particularly common reasons for not completing the census. This Toolkit is meant to guide census workers through the most common participation barriers that can be applied by Census partners in communications and outreach efforts surrounding the 2020 Decennial.

It provides useful evidence-based guidance, worksheets, and printable materials on how to make census communications as effective as possible that include. Key outreach efforts in the toolkit include:
- **Make it actionable** - reducing friction in the path towards action is critical, and sometimes the smallest tweaks can have a significant impact.
- **Make it relevant** - position your message to work for the audience you hope to engage, accounting for what’s important to them and what motivates them
- **Plan the delivery** - meet people where they’re at, the packaging of your message matters

Additionally, four participation barriers are identified, including outreach strategies for each barrier, through the following personas:
- **“I don’t think the census has any impact on my life.”** This person isn’t sure what the census does, how its data affects them, and why their participation matters.
- **“I don’t feel comfortable sharing my information.”** This person is concerned about data privacy or having their information used by other federal agencies.
- **“I have trouble completing census forms.”** This person may not be a native English speaker and finds census forms confusing.
- **“I don’t have time to fill out the census.”** This person is very busy and assumes the census will be time-consuming and cumbersome.

We hope the Community Outreach Toolkit can provide tangible tips and guidance for census workers as they work to make sure everyone is counted for the 2020 Census!
