## Using Evidence: Learning from Low-Cost Federal Evidence-Building Activities

Join the U.S. General Services Administrationâ€™s (GSA) Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) and numerous agency collaborators to learn how your federal government colleagues are using low-cost evaluations, unexpected results, and administrative data to inform policy and program decisions. In three brief sessions, OES staff, distinguished academic partners, and collaborators from multiple agencies will present learnings from more than <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/work/"> 10 rapid cycle evaluations</a>.

The sessions will cover:
### Learning from Low-Cost Evaluations: OES 2019 Results
How agencies are applying new evidence from low-cost evaluations in diverse program areas, including patient-generated health data, wage reporting, and vaccine uptake.

### Learning from Unexpected Results 
How to plan for unexpected results and use them to make policy decisions, develop learning agendas, and support ongoing evidence-building.

### Learning from Administrative Data
How administrative data can be used to answer priority questions and generate evidence in key cross-agency priorities.
