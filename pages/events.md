In **Learning from Unexpected Results**, agency experts in evaluation will discuss how to learn from and act on results that may be surprising. The session will present project examples of different types of unexpected results, and perspectives from agency evaluation leads on how they have learned from such results.  Panelists will describe studies that yielded null results and answer questions about how they have used unexpected results to advance learning agendas in their agencies:

  - **Susan Wilschke** (Office of Research, Demonstration, and Employment Support, Social Security Administration)
