## What was the challenge?

The U.S. General Service Administrationâ€™s USAGov sought to administer a survey to learn more about their email subscribers and what messages would increase survey completion.

## What was the program change?

Evidence-based insights informed the design of three emails. One email included a photo of the USAGov team and personalized signature to make the request more personal, real, and trustworthy. A second email expressed gratitude before the personal survey request to promote survey completion through reciprocity. A third email included a timeline to show the process of how and when responses would be use to make government operations transparent.

## How did the evaluation work?

USAGov email subscribers were randomly assigned to be sent one of four email messages (or sets of messages): the personal survey email, the personal survey email plus the gratitude email one week before, the process survey email, or the business-as-usual survey email.

## What was the impact?

Compared to the business-as-usual email group, survey completion was 0.10% higher in the process email group, 0.13% lower in the personal plus gratitude email group, and 0.05% lower, but not statistically different, in the personal email group.
