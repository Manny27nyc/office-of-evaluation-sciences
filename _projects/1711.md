## What was the challenge?

Between 2014 and 2017, the individual mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act required most individuals to have a minimum level of health insurance coverage or to pay a penalty when filing taxes. **About 8 million families paid an average tax penalty of $210 for lack of coverage in 2014**, the first year the provision was implemented. 

## What was the program change?

During the open-enrollment period for 2017 health insurance coverage, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) **sent informational letters to households who owed a positive tax penalty under the individual mandate for the 2015 tax year and appeared eligible for health insurance.** The letters included information about coverage options, details on how to apply, and possible ways to enroll. 

## How did the evaluation work?

**Informational letters were sent to 4,526,719 randomly selected households. The letters varied in content and timing.** The basic letter included a personalized estimate of the potential penalty the household might owe for 2017, and was sent out either at the beginning of the open enrollment period, or close to the sign-up deadline. A first variant of the basic letter included general penalty information, and a second version of the letter included information about how to claim an exemption. Finally, the basic letters and each of the two variants included a Spanish translation or not.

## What was the impact?

**Receiving any letter increased the probability of an individual obtaining at least one month of 2017 health insurance coverage by 0.85 percentage points.** This represents a 1.24% increase relative to 68.5% coverage among individuals in households that did not receive a letter. The most effective letter was the one sent early in the open-enrollment period which also included a personalized estimate; this letter led to a 1.19 percentage point increase in enrollment.
