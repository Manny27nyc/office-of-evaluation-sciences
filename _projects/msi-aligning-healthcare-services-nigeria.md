## What was the challenge?

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) aims to advance and support voluntary family planning (FP) and reproductive health around the globe, particularly in priority countries such as Nigeria. Short birth intervals contribute to greater risk of adverse birth outcomes, preterm birth, and neonatal morbidity. In Nigeria, a variety of barriers limit access to family planning among those who seek services, including womenâ€™s ability to travel, and living far away from the nearest health facility.

## What was the program change?

Women were offered voluntary FP counseling during one of their health clinics visits for recommended child immunization visits, an opportunity to reduce logistical and convenience barriers. This evidence-based intervention included a script for health facility staff to help women to think through their preferences, and appointment cards for women to record their stated preferences, when they were not able to access same day services. The pilot was designed to explore the feasibility of offering FP counseling (including the script and appointment card) during child immunization visits, and to pilot data collection strategies on these important health behaviors. 

## How did the evaluation work?

Four clinics in Niger and Ogun states, and 677 women attending immunization clinics between September 2017 and December 2018, were included in the feasibility pilot. The evidence-based insights were tested using quasi-experimental difference in design. States and clinics were matched on key characteristics using administrative data. All four clinics in the sample piloted offering standard FP services during child immunizations. Two of these clinics tested the additional provider script for health facility staff and appointment cards. The outcome of interest was FP take up rates, which were compared before and after the start of the intervention period by clinic. 

## What was the impact?

The pilot results show that new mothers welcomed the convenience of accessing family planning services during their immunization visits.  There is suggestive evidence that integrating family planning in immunization clinics increased attendance in family planning clinics around the time of the study. However, many mothers reported needing more time to consider options and deliberate with their spouse.  Among participants who report an interest in taking up FP, many respondents leave the clinic without a method, often citing time constraints as a reason for not receiving a method.
