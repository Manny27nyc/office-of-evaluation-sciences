Steps to create a new project or update an exisiting analysis plan to add complete project materials to the website:

TO UPDATE AN EXISITING ANALYSIS PLAN PAGE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT SUMMARY:
1) In the _projects folder, click on the project page you want to update (this will exist from creating the analysis plan page).
2) Once the project page opens, click on the pencil icon in the upper left corner to edit the project profile text.
3) Copy/paste the four-question project summary text in lines 85 to 102 of this template below to replace the existing general 
   description.
4) Update the "Abstract" (line 8 of the project page) and "Summary" (line 12) in the YAML heading (the text between the two sets 
   of dashes (---)). Update the link in line 101 below to reflect the patch of the analysis plan commit.
      - Abstract should now show path to the Abstract file - e.g., /assets/abstract/1742-reducing-energy-costs.pdf
      - Summary should now include the overview sentence (with a period)
      - Link to analysis plan commit can be taken from the analysis plan page text
5) Scroll down to the radio buttons at the bottom of the page, below the text entry box, and select "Create a new branch"
6) Name the branch with your project number
7) Click the green button that reads "Propose new file"

Now, upload your Abstract and complete the following final items: 
8) Being sure that you are still in the new branch you created (check this by looking in the grey box to the right of where it says 
    "office-of-evaluation-sciences" in the top left of the page; it should read "Branch: projectnumber"), navigate to /assets/abstracts/,
    and upload the pdf file of the abstract. Name it with the project number and project title. Use dashes (-) between words.
    <<DO NOT use spaces in the file name>> (abstract file name e.g., "1618-On-Base-Active-Choice-for-TSP.pdf")
9) Go to the federalist to preview the page. You will be auto-logged in through GitHub. The link is of the form: 
    https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/branch/permalink/
    where the branch is the branch number you are saving to in Step 6 and the permalink is what you specify in line 3 at the top of
    your project page. An example
    is: https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/1809/projects/increasing-attendance-seattle/
10) Email Amira and Kelly to let us know you have built the page for review

TO CREATE A NEW PROJECT (SHOULD NOT APPLY POST 2019)
1) In the _projects folder, click "create new file" in the uper right corner
2) Once the new page opens, in the text box after "/assets/_projects/", type in:
  - the project number (all four digits), followed by a dash
  - a shorthand project title, with any words separated by dashes (not spaces)
  - ".md" to ensure the page formats correctly
  - EXAMPLE: 1619-active-choice-tsp.md
3) In the blank text box of the new page you created, copy and paste the text below, staring on line 71. Be sure to include 
   the dashes (---) at the top when you copy the example. The information between the two sets of three dashes (lines 71-84)  
   is needed to define key parameters on the webpage.
   NOTE: delete the text following the colons (:) in the header section and replace with the relevant project information.
4) Update the path in line 101 below to link directly to the history for your commits to the analysis plan document. The path is of
   the form: https://github.com/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/commits/master/assets/analysis/analysis-plan-file-name.pdf
   where the analysis plan file name is the same path as specified in line 77 below.
5) Scroll down to the radio buttons at the bottom of the page below the text entry box and select "Create a new branch"
6) Name the branch with your project number
7) CLick the green button that reads "Propose new file"

Once you have clicked that button, you've successfully created a branch that your agency will be able to preview. Now that you have
created the page and specific project branch, complete the following final items: 
9) Search on Google Images (using only "Licenses for reuse in the "Advanced" filter criteria) or Flickr.com (using only "US Government 
   work" or "No known copyrights") as the license filter in the top left corner, to choose a picture that will be the thumbnail and
   header photo. Save the image to your desktop with your project number as the file name, note the image credit (link to the
   photographer's flickr site) for later use.
10) Being sure that you are still in the new branch you created (check this by looking in the grey box to the right of where it says 
    "office-of-evaluation-sciences in the top left of the page; it should read "Branch: projectnumber"), upload the image into
     assets/img/project-images/.
   - leave this window open in a separate tab for easy copy/pasting later
11) Being sure that you are still in the new branch you created (check this by looking in the grey box to the right of where it says 
    "office-of-evaluation-sciences" in the top left of the page; it should read "Branch: projectnumber"), navigate to /assets/abstracts/,
    and upload the pdf file of the abstract. Name it with the project number and project title. Use dashes (-) between words.    
    <<DO NOT use spaces in the file name>> (abstract file name e.g., "1618-On-Base-Active-Choice-for-TSP.pdf")
    - leave this window open in a separate tab for easy copy/pasting later
12) Return to the original project page you first created. For the three fields you left blank (image, image-source, and abstract),
    replace the existing content with the information for the new image and abstract you just created.
13) Commit changes
14) Go to the federalist to preview the page. You will be auto-logged in through GitHub. The link is of the form: 
    https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/branch/permalink/
    where the branch is the branch number you are saving to in Step 6 and the permalink is what you specify in line 73 below. An example
    is: https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/1809/projects/increasing-attendance-seattle/
15) Email Amira and Kelly to let us know you have built the page for review
