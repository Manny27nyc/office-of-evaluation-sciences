    <div style="text-align: left; padding-right: 10px;">
      A learning agenda helps agencies plan for evidencebuilding activities and can lead to organizational
      learning. Under the Foundations for Evidence-Based
      Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act), Chief
      Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies are now required
      to develop a learning agenda, while non-CFO Act
      agencies and agency sub-components are encouraged
      to create them. There is no prescribed structure for the
      learning agenda, but there are required components
      described in Phase 1 Implementation of the
      Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of
      2018: Learning Agendas, Personnel, and Planning
      Guidance (OMB M-19-23). Agencies have the flexibility to design the document in a way
      that makes it useful to their unique needs, including those of leadership, programs, and
      other stakeholders. A learning agenda can facilitate evidence generation, leading to
      informed decisions about an agency’s policies, programs, operations, and regulations.

      <p><b> What is a learning agenda
      (evidence-building plan)? </b></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">[A learning agenda is] is a
      systematic plan for identifying
      and addressing priority
      questions relevant to the
      programs, policies, and
      regulations of the agency… to

          improvement.</i> Learning agenda development
          and implementation includes frequent internal
          and external stakeholder engagement. As
          described throughout this toolkit, the
          Evaluation Officer (EO) and related staff can
          use engagement opportunities to educate
          and encourage stakeholders to build and use
          evidence. </p>

          internal and external stakeholders to identify
          priority areas. By engaging stakeholders early
          and often, an agency can continuously build

    <p style="text-align: left;"><b> Initial Steps to Developing a Learning Agenda </b> </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">The EO and related staff can use the resources in this toolkit to design and execute a
    learning agenda process best suited to agency needs. Here are a few examples of
    steps your agency can take now to advance the learning agenda process:</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; color: #2E9AC4">Review your agency’s major plans to understand its evidence base.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"> Your agency may already use evidence to inform strategy and operations. For example, several
      agency Strategic Plans include sections on program evaluation or evidence-based
      policymaking and decision-making. The learning agenda process can build off these
      existing activities.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; color: #2E9AC4">Meet with key decision makers in your agency.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"> Senior leaders are critical and
      required stakeholders in the learning agenda process. In an initial meeting with senior
      leadership, the EO and related staff could discuss the benefits listed above and how the
      learning agenda will be used. Consider establishing a formal Evidence Leadership
      Council with senior leaders, including the agency Chief Data Officer (CDO) and
      Statistical Official (SO) (the other designated officials established by the Evidence Act).
      The council or working group could receive updates on the process and deliberate on
      the plan’s components. Download the attachment in the tab to the right for a one-page
      Learning Agenda Overview to share with agency staff.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left; color: #2E9AC4">Establish a cross-functional leadership team.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> The EO should consider establishing
      formal, recurring meetings with the CDO and SO. <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#5""><b>As described in Section 5:
      Developing a Learning Agenda</b></a>, other officials may be valuable to include in the
      recurring meetings, such as the Chief Risk Officer, PIO, or PMIO. Where possible and
      appropriate, these officials should join meetings with senior leadership together. When
      discussing agency issues, it is valuable to have the diverse perspectives of strategy,
      evidence, data, and statistical leaders.</p>
