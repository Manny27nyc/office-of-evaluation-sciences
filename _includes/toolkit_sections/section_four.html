      Consistent leadership support and buy-in is
      critical to the learning agenda process. This
      section provides tips on how to engage with
      agency leaders and ensure that the learning
      agenda addresses their needs and priorities.
      Additionally, this section gives advice on how to
      gather feedback and input from leadership,
      specifically on priority learning agenda questions.
      Sustained leadership support can lead to
      effective learning agenda implementation,
      ultimately generating evidence that will be used
      by leadership within your agency’s budget and policy timeframes.

      <p style="text-align: left;"> Agency leadership should be engaged
      in the development and implementation
      of the learning agenda, as their buy-in
      and support for determining what highpriority questions should be included,
      which stakeholders should inform the
      process, and which staff and data
      assets will be needed to fulfill the
      learning agenda, are critical to success.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"> More broadly than the learning agenda, the Evaluation Officer (EO) and related staff
    can signal to leadership that a culture of learning and continuous improvement starts at
    the top. To transform an agency’s culture, the EO and related staff need to be
    supported by champions who exemplify a commitment to building and using evidence in
    their work. A learning culture is central to a meaningful and effective learning agenda. </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>General Tips for Gaining Leadership Input and Support</b></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"> When designing your agency’s learning agenda process, consider the following tips for
    how and when to engage leadership.  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style='color:#2E9AC4'><b>Gather input from leadership upfront.</b></span> You can lay the foundation for leadership buyin by asking how the learning agenda could be useful to them. Leadership engagement
    is a requirement per the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018
    (Evidence Act), but with many initiatives competing for leadership attention, it may be
    challenging to find an opportunity for engagement. Nonetheless, look for ways to
    engage the most senior leadership possible, up to and including the agency head. A
    sample meeting agenda is included at the bottom of this section to help you facilitate
    conversations with leadership, and additional tips can be found on <span style='color:orange'><b>Worksheet 2</b></span> of the
    Learning Agenda Workbook (available for download in the tab to the right). Also, see
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#1"><b>Section 1: Purpose and Benefits</b></a> for an overview of the benefits of a learning agenda. </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style='color:#2E9AC4'><b>Engage leadership at the right level of detail.</b></span> Agency leaders do not need to become
    experts on the Evidence Act or learning agendas to provide input on priority questions,
    key stakeholders, or learning activities. Think about how to communicate the right level
    of detail to leadership, emphasizing the big picture.  </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style='color:#2E9AC4'><b>Make connections between learning agendas and leadership priorities.</b></span> It is
    important to frame the learning agenda process in ways that will resonate with
    leadership. Consider starting with a review of your agency’s Strategic Plan and
    leadership memos. When requesting a meeting and setting the agenda, present the learning agenda as a coordination tool to help support leadership goals and priorities.
    For example, if your leadership strongly values innovation, emphasize that the learning
    agenda can support the agency in building evidence on innovative solutions to
    challenges. Demonstrate how the learning agenda will help clarify where problems
    exist, encourage new approaches to problem-solving, and prompt the development of
    credible evidence around the efficacy of those approaches.   </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style='color:#2E9AC4'><b>Share success stories from other agencies.</b></span> Help leadership understand why a
    learning agenda is useful by illustrating how other organizations have used learning
    agendas to improve performance or increase return on their investments. For example,
    the Small Business Administration organized its learning agenda around its strategic
    goals, an approach that helped the agency determine how well its technical assistance
    program for small businesses was helping those businesses grow. You can find more
    information about how agencies have implemented prior learning agendas in <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#8"><b>Section 8:
    Additional Resources.</b></a> </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style='color:#2E9AC4'><b>Regularly report progress to leadership.</b></span> A frequent cadence of progress reports to
    leadership maintains their buy-in and support. Topics of discussion might include the
    status of learning agenda development or results from evidence-building activities that
    shed light on priority issues and challenges. Consider incorporating these updates into
    existing, regular meetings with leadership. </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Designing a Meeting with Leadership</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">When designing a meeting agenda using <span style='color:orange'><b>Worksheet 2</b></span> of the Learning Agenda
    Workbook, consider the tips described above. For your first meeting, you might focus on
    getting initial input into your agency’s priority learning agenda questions. Following
    internal and external stakeholder engagement, a future meeting with leadership could
    include a set of draft priority questions and a request for feedback. Each meeting with
    leadership should have a clear set of objectives and desired outcomes. The sample
    meeting agenda below is designed to elicit priority questions or other learning agenda
    content from leadership. </p>
