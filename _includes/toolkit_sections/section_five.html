  <h2 class="heading"> Agencies have the flexibility to design their learning agendas in a format that addresses
    their unique needs. How will your approach ensure that the learning agenda is a living
    document for continuous learning and improvement?
  </h2>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    This section offers suggestions for the Evaluation Officer (EO) and related staff on how
    to develop a tailored learning agenda process to meet your agency’s needs. The
    primary resource for this section is the Master Checklist, which can be downloaded on
    the tab to the right. The Master Checklist provides high-level required activities and
    some suggested activities to develop your agency’s learning agenda. For more detailed
    project planning, please reference <b><span style='color:orange'>Worksheet #3</span></b> of the Learning Agenda Workbook
    (available for download in the tab to the right).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>General Tips </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style='color:#2E9AC4'><b>Listen for questions at every opportunity.</b></span> In addition to a formal learning agenda
    process, encourage the learning agenda core team or key stakeholders to model the
    culture of learning and continuous improvement you are striving to build (see <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#3"><b>Section 3:
    Engaging Stakeholders)</b></a>. When issues are discussed in any agency meetings,
    consider asking yourself, “Could that be a learning agenda question?” </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style='color:#2E9AC4'><b>
      Incorporate iterative and ongoing stakeholder engagement.</b></span> Regardless of the size
      and scope of outreach and engagement efforts, ongoing stakeholder engagement is
      critical to fostering a culture of learning and continuous improvement.
    </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Planning Stakeholder Engagement Activities </b>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      In <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#3"><b>Section 3: Engaging Stakeholders,</b></a> the EO and related staff identified key
      stakeholders for the learning agenda process using <b><span style='color:orange'>Worksheet #1</span></b> of the Learning
      Agenda Workbook. Consider how you will be strategic and deliberate to engage
      stakeholders while efficiently using your available resources. This includes the timing
      and length of engagement activities, as well as the number of stakeholders you will
      engage with at a time. In initial meetings, consider establishing recurring
      communications. To maintain a learning agenda as a living document, stakeholder
      engagement must be iterative and ongoing.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Stakeholder engagement is also an opportunity to educate others about evidence. Level
      of expertise on evidence should not preclude anyone from voicing their opinions on the
      agency’s priority questions and learning activities. Stakeholder engagement can
      cultivate curiosity and encourage participation in the agency’s learning culture. You can
      signal to agency staff that the learning agenda and other evidence-building activities are
      not simply compliance exercises, but tools that will ultimately help them to improve the
      effectiveness of their programs.
    </p>

        <b>Interim and Final Learning Agenda</b>
        The approach to developing the final,
        published learning agenda in fiscal year
        (FY) 2022 may differ from that of the
        interim learning agenda. For example, if
        you choose to align your learning agenda
        and strategic planning processes, the next
        cycle of strategic planning likely will not
        start until February 2021. Download the
        Master Checklist in the tab to the right for a
        high-level timeline to complete the
        Foundations for Evidence-Based
        Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act) Phase 1 requirements in FY 2020. Also,
        <b><span style='color:orange'>Worksheet #3</span></b> of the Learning Agenda Workbook includes a separate table to create a
        project plan for the interim learning agenda.

        <p><b>OMB M-19-23 Reference</b></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
          Because this interim learning agenda is being
          developed during the last year of an agency’s
          Strategic Plan, the interim learning agenda
          should be written to address short-term priority
          questions that can be answered more
          immediately and long-term questions that are
          directly linked to the agency’s core statutory
          mission and therefore are unlikely to differ
          substantively from one strategic planning cycle to
          the next.

    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Alignment with Existing Plans and Processes</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      The learning agenda is a section of the Strategic Plan. While agencies are encouraged
      to align the learning agenda process with the strategic planning process, it is not
      required. Alignment with the Strategic Plan, or other major agency plans, can help
      streamline requirements, optimize available resources, and improve your understanding
      of agency priorities. The laws, plans, and activities described below are a few examples
      the EO should consider reviewing for alignment with the learning agenda process.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      The first table of plans and processes fall under the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ352/PLAW-111publ352.pdf">GPRA Modernization Act
      (GPRAMA) of 2010.</a> GPRAMA requires quarterly performance assessments of
      government programs, provides updated guidance on agency Strategic Plans, and
      establishes the role of Performance Improvement Officer (PIO) and the Performance
      Improvement Council. The PIO is responsible for Office of Management and Budget
      (OMB) submissions and final publication of all plans produced under GPRAMA. The
      table below includes an overview of each plan and a list of questions the EO and PIO
      may want discuss for how each plan or process could align with the learning agenda.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      In addition to the list below, your agency may align its learning agenda process to fiveyear and/or annual research plans, or cycles in policy analysis, regulatory planning, or
      budget development. It is important to consider your agency’s processes across all four
      components of evidence. Especially for agencies with limited resources, an EO can take
      advantage of this wealth of information for potential learning agenda content.
