  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Though the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires certain components to be
    included in your agency’s Annual Evaluation, you have the flexibility to include additional
    information about the evaluations that may offer more detail or insight into future plans. The
    table below summarizes the components that agencies must include, as specified by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/M-19-23.pdf">
    OMB M19-23</a>, as well as optional elements that could provide more context about how the planned
    evaluations will help address learning agenda priority questions.

  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Writing the Plan</b></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    You have developed a learning agenda, identified current and recent evaluations, possibly
    developed new evaluations, and determined which evaluations are “significant.” Now, it is time
    to bring that all together into a written Annual Evaluation Plan. For a sample evaluation
    description, please download the handout in the tab to the right.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Consider using the checklist below to ensure each of your evaluation descriptions contains all
    required components
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Clearly state the questions to be answered.</span></b>
    The Annual Evaluation Plan should include
    questions that will be addressed by the agency’s “significant” evaluations. For help crafting a
    strong evaluation question, see the Evaluation Planning Quick Tips guide, which can be
    downloaded on the Annual Evaluation Plan Toolkit homepage
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Describe the information needed to conduct the evaluation.</span></b>
    Your agency will need to describe
    what data are available and how they might be used to answer your evaluation questions.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Administrative data, such as program data or outcomes data that your agency already tracks,
    are a low-cost alternative to gathering new data. Keep in mind that using administrative data
    might mean that your agency will need to make specific plans for accessing and using it, such as
    obtaining clearances for contractors or cleaning data for external use.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    If administrative data are not sufficient for addressing an evaluation question, new data might
    be collected by administering surveys or assessments or conducting interviews or focus groups.
    If new data must be collected, it is important that your timeline account for any necessary
    Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) or research approvals from jurisdictions or other entities from
    which you seek to collect data.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    For further considerations about data availability and examples of strong practices from federal
    agencies, please see the Evaluation Planning Quick Tips guide.

    A strong evaluation plan uses methods that are wellmatched to the evaluation questions. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/M-19-23.pdf">OMB M-19-23</a> notes that agencies should “use the most
    rigorous methods possible that align to identified questions.” This statement implies that questions should drive the choice of methods, not the other way around. For more information
    on methods, refer to the Evaluation Planning Quick Tips guide.

    Most evaluations include challenges that warrant mitigation

    describe any challenges that you anticipate encountering in carrying out the evaluation. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/M-19-23.pdf">OMB
    M-19-23</a> does not require your agency to identify mitigation strategies for the challenges you
    describe in your plan, but if you have identified such strategies, you could include them for
    additional context.

    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Describe a plan for sharing evaluation findings with relevant stakeholders. </span></b>
    The Annual
    Evaluation Plan should describe how your agency intends to disseminate results. This includes
    considering how to frame evaluation results for different audiences. There are three
    considerations that may inform the development of your dissemination plans:
  </p>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li> <i>Timing:</i> For evaluation results to meaningfully inform ongoing agency work and the
      learning agenda, agencies may take into account whether there are any important
      upcoming decisions that could be informed by the evaluation. </li>
    <li><i>Relevance:</i> Consider who needs to be informed of evaluation result: to whom is the
      evaluation relevant, and how might they use the information? </li>
    <li><i>Method:</i> Different audiences might need different strategies to alert them to a
      completed evaluation and help them to understand the findings. </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Use <b><span style='color: orange'>Worksheet #2 </span></b>
    of the Annual Evaluation Plan Workbook to brainstorm dissemination
   approaches. For additional information about appropriate formats and channels of
   communication, see the <i>Evaluation Planning Quick Tips</i> guide.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color: orange'>Worksheet #3 </span></b>
    can help you summarize evaluations along some of the key dimensions
    highlighted in this section. The following toolkit sections describe the considerations for each
    dimension and suggest activities for developing the content of the Annual Evaluation Plan.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Optional Components of the Plan </b></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    While not required, additional components that could be included in summaries of significant
    evaluations are described below. This list of optional components is not exhaustive. Agencies
    may decide to include additional optional components if they are helpful in describing
    significant evaluations.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Provide a rationale for why your agency considers this evaluation “significant.” </span></b>
    See <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/annualinfo#3"><b>Section 3:
    Defining Significant Evaluations</b></a> for guidance on developing criteria for “significant” and
    creating a process for using the criteria to assess evaluations. Including an explanation as to
    why a study is “significant” provides insights into your agency’s evaluation priorities.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Describe the program, policy, or initiative being studied. </span></b>
    A description of the program, policy,
    or initiative could provide helpful context for your agency’s evaluations. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/M-19-23.pdf">OMB M-19-23</a> suggests
    that agencies include program logic models in their Annual Evaluation Plan to visually depict
    how a program being evaluated is expected to function.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Provide background on what is already known. </span></b>
    Your agency could choose to show how its
    “significant” evaluations build on previous studies conducted internally or by others. If an
    evaluation is part of a multi-year evaluation portfolio that aims to answer a complex question,
    the description could explain how the current evaluation builds on what your agency has
    learned from completed studies.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Describe how your agency anticipates using the findings. </span></b>
    This information can help explain the
    practical value of an evaluation to stakeholders. If a “significant” evaluation is part of a set of
    related studies, the description could explain how your agency will use findings from the
    evaluation and the other studies to answer a question.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Describe relevant evaluation logistics. </span></b>
    Evaluation logistics include questions such as: who will
    conduct the study? How will your agency fund it? Does the evaluation have key phases that are
    important to communicate? You may choose to discuss logistics in an evaluation description if
    there is something noteworthy about your agency’s plans. For example, if your agency is
    conducting an evaluation through an ongoing research partnership with an academic
    institution, you might want to share this information to highlight your agency’s resourcefulness
    in addressing learning agenda priorities.
