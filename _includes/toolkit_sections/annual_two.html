      <p>Evaluation Officers (EOs) oversee the development of
      the Annual Evaluation Plan, but others at your agency
      can offer important insights. When developing a plan
      for whom to engage in the process, consider which
      stakeholders will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Participate in a core team (optional) that helps to develop the Annual Evaluation Plan</li>
        <li> Make final decisions on the plan</li>
        <li> Help to identify “significant” evaluations and inform content for the plan</li>
        <li> Receive updates on Annual Evaluation Plan developments</li>

      <p><b> Creating an Annual Evaluation Plan:
        Management and Leadership of the
        Process </b></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The agency’s designated Evaluation
        Officer [EO] shall lead, coordinate,
        develop and implement the Annual
        Evaluation Plan. The EO will play a
        leading role in the development and
        implementation of the Annual
        Evaluation Plan at the agency level and
        also support efforts to develop plans at
        the sub-agency, operational division, or
        bureau level.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"> <b> Identifying Key Stakeholders</b> </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Core Team:</span></b> Agencies are not required to create a core team to develop the Annual Evaluation
    Plan. If your agency opted to create a core team to lead learning agenda development,
    members of this group could also contribute to creating and updating the Annual Evaluation
    Plan (see <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/annualinfo#3"><b>Section 3: Engaging Stakeholders</b></a> in the Learning Agenda Toolkit for more
    information about forming a core team). Some agencies might find that a core team comprised
    of individuals from a range of offices can increase staff buy-in and diversify perspectives. Other
    agencies might find it more efficient to develop the plan within the agency’s evaluation office,
    consulting with valuable stakeholders for information at key points during the process.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    As creating and updating the Annual Evaluation Plan requires technical expertise in evaluation
    design and methods, the individuals responsible for developing content should be
    knowledgeable about data and evaluation. Key partners might include your agency’s Chief Data
    Officer (CDO), who can advise on data access, and the Statistical Official (SO), who can offer
    insight into issues such as data quality and sound statistical methods. Agencies with
    decentralized evaluation activities might consider involving representatives from sub-agencies
    to enhance understanding of the full scope of ongoing and planned evaluations throughout the
    agency. Other partners could include the Performance Improvement Officer and related staff,
    and individuals from your agency’s internal research or analytics offices.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Leadership:</span></b> Agency leaders are critical partners in the Annual Evaluation Plan development
      process. As leadership provides the final signoff on the plan, their buy-in is necessary to carry
      out evaluations and promote the use of findings within the agency. To engage leaders early on,
      the EO could facilitate an initial conversation to explain the Annual Evaluation Plan
      development process, discuss leaders’ priorities for or concerns about the process, and
      strategize about resources to support evaluations. The EO and related staff can establish
      recurring communications with leadership to ensure access to the resources needed to conduct
      evaluations.

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Stakeholders who can inform content:</span></b> Beyond the
          core team and leadership, consider the range of
          internal and external stakeholders who can offer
          useful perspectives or insights. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/M-19-23.pdf">OMB M-19-23</a> dictates
          that program staff should be consulted if they will be
          responsible for supporting a significant evaluation or
          using findings. Program staff can be helpful in
          informing what questions the agency should be
          asking, which evaluations are “significant,” and how to
          use evaluation findings.

        Plan and those that will follow. … Internal

    <p style="text-align: center;"> <b>How the Small Business Administration Engages Program Staff in Evaluation Planning</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      The Office of Program Performance, Analysis and Evaluation works with program offices throughout the year to
      discuss evaluation possibilities and offer technical assistance. <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/final%20508%20Framework%20and%20Guidelines%20for%20Program%20Evaluation%20at%20the%20US%20Small%20Business%20Administration%2003%2013%202019.pdf"><b>
        The annual call for proposals</b></a> grows from
      discussions with program managers who want to identify questions that, if answered, could improve their
      program’s performance.
    </p>
      <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li> <b>Call for Evaluation Proposals:</b> Each winter, program offices are invited to submit program evaluation
        proposals for awards. The template requires program managers to develop 3-6 questions that relate to
        the operations of the program or its outcomes, and explain how the evaluation will support
        recommendations that could improve program processes or enhance service delivery.</li>
        <li> <b>Proposal Review:</b> The lead program evaluator will convene a team to consider the proposals, and the
        team will make recommendations to senior leadership about which proposals to support in that
        evaluation cycle.</li>
        <li> <b>Proposal Selection:</b> : SBA funds four to five new evaluations each year that are managed by one of SBA’s
        lead program evaluators and a team of independent contractors. SBA aims to complete evaluations
        within 12 to 15 months. </li>
        <li> <b>Impact:</b> The evaluations have helped SBA program managers identify and improve actions for program
        operations and outcomes, support efficiency gains, and enhance service delivery. The program
        evaluation call for proposals supports the current year’s Enterprise Learning Agenda and SBA’s progress
        toward its strategic goals and objectives.</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Agencies may choose to consult external stakeholders while developing an Annual Evaluation
    Plan due to their content expertise, familiarity with relevant communities, or ability to help
    identify useful evaluation questions for the broader field.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Stakeholders who should be kept apprised:</span></b> Other internal or external stakeholders may need
    to stay informed about evaluations selected for the Annual Evaluation Plan. For example, it
    might make sense to inform a key community or advocacy group that a grant program intended
    to meet their needs will be included on the agency’s plan. More broadly, agencies should
    consider how to share the plan with agency staff and the public to enhance transparency and
    foster a shared purpose.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:orange'>Activity 1</span></b>  of the Annual Evaluation Plan Workbook provides one approach for mapping the landscape of stakeholders who could be involved
    in the Annual Evaluation Plan development process. <b><span style='color:orange'>Activity 2</span></b> of the Annual Evaluation Plan
    Workbook is intended to help you determine the role each stakeholder may take on.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"> <b> When to Engage Stakeholders</b> </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Agencies may differ in the extent to which they involve stakeholders outside of the core team
    to help shape the Annual Evaluation Plan, but two key opportunities at which stakeholders are
    likely to enhance the process are:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Identifying “significant” evaluations.</span></b> The Annual Evaluation Plan includes only evaluations that
    your agency determines to be “significant” according to the criteria that it develops. For more
    about developing criteria for “significant” evaluations, please refer to <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/annualinfo#3"><b>Section 3: Defining
    Significant Evaluations.</b></a>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    One approach to involving stakeholders in the development of criteria for “significant”
    evaluations is to engage them in small-group brainstorming and prioritization activities.<b><span style='color:orange'> Activity
    3</span></b> of the Annual Evaluation Plan Workbook provides a sample meeting agenda for such
    activities. Alternatively, your agency might decide to solicit feedback from stakeholders on
    possible criteria developed by the core team or the EO. Providing an opportunity for staff
    outside of the evaluation office to weigh in on criteria could enhance their understanding of the
    Annual Evaluation Plan purpose and process.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    One approach to involving stakeholders in the development of criteria for “significant”
    evaluations is to engage them in small-group brainstorming and prioritization activities. <b><span style='color:orange'>Activity 4</span></b>
    3 of the Annual Evaluation Plan Workbook provides a sample meeting agenda for such
    activities. Alternatively, your agency might decide to solicit feedback from stakeholders on
    possible criteria developed by the core team or the EO. Providing an opportunity for staff
    outside of the evaluation office to weigh in on criteria could enhance their understanding of the
    Annual Evaluation Plan purpose and process.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Developing content for the Annual Evaluation Plan.</span></b> Key stakeholders, such as your agency’s
    program staff, can assist evaluation staff in clarifying specific evaluation questions, identifying
    opportunities for rigorous evaluation, and designing strategies for targeted engagement of key
    external stakeholders. These activities can generate basic information about a planned evaluation that can be included the Annual Evaluation Plan.
    <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/M-19-23.pdf">OMB M-19-23</a> acknowledges that
    “forecasting evaluation activities in advance may be challenging” and encourages agencies to
    provide the level of detail that is feasible
