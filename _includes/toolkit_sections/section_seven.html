    How will you design the learning agenda to be meaningful to your agency?</h2>

  <div style="float: right; background-color: lightgrey; margin: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 500px;">
    <p><b>OMB M-19-23 Reference</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">At a minimum, agencies should include the following types of content in their learning agenda,
      recognizing that this content does not necessarily need to be organized according to these headings:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li>Which Strategic Goals and Objectives that the Learning Agenda will Address</li>
      <li>Priority Questions to be Answered</li>
      <li>Activities that the agency will engage in to address Priority Questions</li>
      <li>Timing of Learning Agenda Activities</li>
      <li>Potential Data, Tools, Methods, and Analytic Approaches to be Used to Answer Priority Questions</li>
      <li>Anticipated Agency-Specific Challenges and Proposed Solutions to Developing Evidence to Support Agency Priorities</li>
  </div>

  <p style="text-align: left;">Your agency’s learning agenda is required to be published with the Strategic Plan and Capacity Assessment at least every four years. Like the Strategic Plan, the learning agenda should be written in plain language to make it easy for internal and external stakeholders to understand. While the guidance released by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) lists specific topics to be included in the learning agenda, as shown in the box to the right, it also emphasizes agencies’ flexibility in designing and structuring their learning agendas (e.g., adding a new section). This toolkit section includes a sample learning agenda question aligned to a strategic goal and a template that categorizes questions by focus area.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: left;">Potential Reference Documents</h3>
  <p style="text-align: left;">The following documents may be useful to reference while writing your agency’s learning agenda:</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Learning Agenda Section Sample</b></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    The following learning agenda section sample for the fictitious Department
    of Societal Betterment can be downloaded at the top of this page. The sample section covers
    all topics listed in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/M-19-23.pdf" style="color:#2E9AC4;">OMB M-19-23</a> box above.</p>

  <div class="blue_div">
    <p style="text-align: center;"> <b>The Department of Societal Betterment</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> <b><i>Mission:</i></b>Reduce societal nuisances</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Context </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      <i>Agency Strategic Goal 1:</i> Make Day-to-Day Living in Our Society More Pleasant
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      <i>Agency Strategic Objective 1.1:</i> Reduce nuisances in public places
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Priority question(s) </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Does new signage emphasizing pride in our public places reduce the incidence of littering?
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Addressing the priority question(s) </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      <i>Background.</i> Littering was found to be one of the top three nuisances in our 2019 annual survey,
      Nuisances that Bug You the Most. Next year we will be implementing an important new initiative that
      uses signs emphasizing pride
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      <i>Addressing the question.</i>  We will use the phase-in stage of the signage initiative to help us learn about
      the impact of the signs on littering. In particular, among the 40 sites around the city that have been
      selected for signage, we will randomly select half (20) to receive the signs first for a six-month period.
      During that time, there will be 20 sites with signage (program group) and 20 sites without (control
      group), allowing for a comparison of littering incidence. We will also examine time-trend data at each
      site to see if littering varies in the months before and after implementation of the signs.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      To do these analyses, we will use existing data on the amount of litter collected by our Streets and
      Parks Departments. We may supplement that information with survey data from users of targeted
      parks and streets.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      One challenge is that there are sometimes special events in particular parks or neighborhoods that
      can skew the data, so we will need to take those factors into account in the analyses. Another
      challenge is sample size: the total number of sites (40) is too small to produce very exacting
      comparisons between treatment and control sites during the phase-in process, but we believe the
      analyses will nonetheless produce useful information. We plan to work with evaluation experts within
      the agency, as well as with university partners as needed, to ensure that we have as credible of an
      evaluation design as possible.

  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Learning Agenda Template</b></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    A fillable template with the headers used below can be found in <b style="color:orange;">Worksheet #5</b> of the
    Learning Agenda Workbook. As a reminder, this is one of many potential ways to format
    the learning agenda.
   </p>


   <div class="blue_div">
     <p style="text-align: left;"> <b>Overview</b></p>
     <p style="text-align: left;">Insert a brief introduction about the agency’s learning agenda aims.
      Refer to <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#1""><b>Section 1: Purpose and
      Benefits</b></a> for the purpose and potential benefits of a learning agenda.</p>
     <p style="text-align: left;">
       Insert an overview of the agency’s stakeholder engagement efforts (process and participants), and how
       internal and external engagement informed the questions included in the learning agenda. Emphasize
       stakeholder engagement required per the Evidence Act – the public, State and local governments, and
       representatives of nongovernmental researchers.
      </p>
     <p style="text-align: left;">
       Include a brief explanation of how your agency defines “short-term” and “long-term” questions included in the
      learning agenda.
     </p>
     <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Focus Area #1 (<i>Optional</i> to organize by focus area) </b></p>
       <ul style="text-align: left;">
         <li> <b>Required:</b> Strategic goals addressed in this section.</li>
         <li> <b>Optional:</b> Other priorities addressed in this section. </li>
         <li> <b>Required:</b> Priority questions relevant to that focus area </li>
         <li> <b>Optional:</b>  Brief explanatory text that would help readers understand the priority question, including
            background information or details.</li>
         <li> <b>Strongly Encouraged:</b> If the question is related to a regulatory action, reference the entry in the
            Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. </li>
       </ul>
    <p style="text-align: left;"> <b>Required: Activities that the Agency will Engage in to Address Priority Questions </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      For each priority question, briefly describe the ways in which your agency will seek to answer that question.
      This description can be high-level, since the potential methods and analytic approaches will be described
      below. Consider combining the sections if necessary.
     </p>
     <p style="text-align: left;"> <b>
       Required: Potential Data, Tools, Methods, and Analytic Approaches to be Used to Answer Priority
      Questions  </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      This section should expand on the learning agenda activities discussed above by providing more details about
      potential data sources, tools, methods, and/or approaches that may be used to answer each question. Note
      the importance of the word “potential” here, as your agency may be just starting the process of identifying how
      priority questions will be answered. Existing capacity to answer a priority question is not a prerequisite for
      inclusion. Where capacity is available, agencies are expected to use the most rigorous method that is feasible
      in answering priority questions.
     </p>
     <p style="text-align: left;">
       To demonstrate compliance with existing laws and regulations, consider including a brief explanation of the
       agency’s data governance related to the potential data sources listed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <i>Note:</i> The Annual Evaluation Plan will provide additional detail on method(s) to be used.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> <b>
        Required: Timing of Learning Agenda Activities </b></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        In this section, briefly describe the timeframe for the activities above. For example, will these activities take
        place over the next year or span multiple years? If there are several activities associated with one priority
        question, describe the timeframe for each.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> <b>
        Required: Anticipated Agency-Specific Challenges and Proposed Solutions to Developing Evidence to
        Support Agency Priorities </b></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Briefly preview one or more of the challenges in undertaking the activities described above. These could be
        challenges specific to an individual question or broader agency challenges. For each challenge, document a
        proposed mitigation strategy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"> <i>*Repeat the five headers above as needed*</i></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> <b>
        Optional: Learning Agenda Updates </b></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Per the Evidence Act, agencies are required to revisit the learning agenda on a minimum of an
        annual basis. Include an explanation of the process and stakeholders involved in making meaningful
        updates to the learning agenda.
