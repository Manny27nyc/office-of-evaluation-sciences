      Under the Foundations for Evidence-Based
      Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act), Chief
      Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies are required to
      develop and publicly share an Annual Evaluation
      Plan. Non-CFO Act agencies and agency subcomponents are encouraged, but not required, to
      create them.

      <p><b>What is the Annual Evaluation Plan?</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        The Annual Evaluation Plan describes the
        evaluation activities the agency plans to
        conduct in the fiscal year following the year
        in which the performance plans are
        submitted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        The Annual Evaluation Plan should include
        “significant” evaluations related to the
        learning agenda and any other “significant”
        evaluations, such as those required by
        statute.
      </p>

    Your agency’s Annual Evaluation Plan:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Has required components. </span></b> The plan must include
    specific information about the “significant”
    evaluations that your agency intends to conduct in a
    given fiscal year. “Significant” evaluations can
    address learning agenda priorities or can be important to the agency for other reasons (e.g.,
    statutorily mandated evaluations). Your agency can determine its own criteria for deeming an
    evaluation “significant.” See <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/annualinfo#3"><b> Section 3: Defining Significant Evaluations</b></a> for tips on developing
    criteria.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Your agency may also include other types of evidence-building activities on the plan as long as
    these activities are clearly identified as such. However, your agency should include this
    information only if it is useful to implement your learning activities in this way.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Explains how your agency’s evaluations connect to the learning agenda. </span></b>
    An Annual Evaluation
    Plan shows how your agency will address learning agenda and other priority questions through
    evaluations and describes the methods that each evaluation will use. It is not a “laundry list” of
    evidence-building activities.

    An Annual Evaluation Plan describes the evaluations that your
    agency will undertake in the fiscal year following publication of the plan. It will be published
    each February concurrent with the Annual Performance Plan.

    The Annual Evaluation Plan Overview, which can be downloaded at the top of this page, provides
    a quick summary of the required and optional components that agencies can choose to include in their plan. These plans can be
    useful even if your agency already has an active evaluation program and shares information
    publicly about its studies. Specifically, developing the plan can help your agency to:

      <p style='color:#2E9AC4; margin-bottom: 0px;'> Promote understanding, transparency, and accountability. </p>
      <p> An Annual Evaluation Plan is an opportunity to
        tell a coherent and compelling story of what
        your agency will evaluate, how your agency’s
        evaluations relate to each other, and how the
        evaluations will help to answer important
        questions. For this reason, a well-written plan
        can inform agency staff and build trust with
        external stakeholders. </p>

    <p>The Evaluation Officer (EO) and your
      agency’s communications office
      could promote the importance of
      the Annual Evaluation Plan to
      agency staff and the public.  </p>

        capacity for evidence building in furthering

      <p> Evaluation planning brings together agency
        staff, with input from external stakeholders, to
        prioritize and plan evaluation activities for the
        coming fiscal year. The development process
        should engage stakeholders from within and
        across your agency and, when feasible and
        appropriate, include the perspectives of
        external stakeholders. This process can also
        build capacity across your agency for using
        evaluations for ongoing improvement. </p>

    <img src="{{ '/assets/img/icons/arrow.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" height="50" width="50" style="margin-top: 100px; margin: 50px;" />
    <p>The EO and related staff could
      involve diverse sub-agency
      representation in a working group
      or core team to brainstorm specific
      opportunities to build evidence in
      the coming year. To build capacity
      among agency staff, the EO could
      offer “Evaluation 101” brown bags
      to introduce important evaluation
      concepts and practices. </p>

        activities to address remaining learning
        agenda priority questions.  </p>
      <p> Updating the Annual Evaluation Plan each year
        allows your agency and its stakeholders to
        reflect on what they have learned from
        completed evaluations and assess progress
        towards using evaluations to answer learning
        agenda and other priority questions. As part of
        this annual process, your agency can identify
        remaining learning agenda priorities that
        require evaluation and plan new studies as
        needed. </p>

    <img src="{{ '/assets/img/icons/arrow.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" height="50" width="50" style="margin-top: 100px; margin: 50px;" />
    <p>Throughout the year, the EO and
      related staff could schedule inperson or web-based presentations
      for evaluators to share what has
      been learned from “significant”
      evaluations and to discuss the
      implications of findings. </p>
