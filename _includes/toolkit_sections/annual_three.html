  <div class="heading_content_wrapper">
    <div style="text-align: left; padding-right: 10px; line-height: 30px;">
      <p>Each agency must develop its own criteria for
      “significant” evaluations, describe these criteria in
      the Annual Evaluation Plan, and apply these
      criteria consistently to determine which
      evaluations to include in the plan. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/M-19-23.pdf">OMB M-19-23</a>
      provides several potential criteria for agencies to
      consider (see box on the right).</p>
      <p>Identifying an evaluation as “significant”
      communicates its special importance to your
      agency and elevates it as a priority for resource
      allocation and stakeholder awareness. The
      designation of some evaluations as “significant”
      does not imply that others are unimportant. For
      many agencies, especially those with active
      evaluation programs, the Annual Evaluation Plan
      may not include all of their ongoing and planned
      evaluations.</p>

      <p><b>OMB M-19-23 Reference</b></p>
      <p><b> What is a “significant” evaluation? </b></p>
      <p> The significance of an evaluation study should take into consideration factors such as:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li> The importance of a program or funding stream to the agency mission;</li>
        <li> The size of the program in terms of funding or people served; and</li>
        <li> The extent to which the study will fill an
          important knowledge gap regarding the
          program, population(s) served, or the
          issue(s) that the program was designed to
          address</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> Agencies should clearly state their criteria for
        designating evaluations as “significant” in
        their plans.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"> <b> Developing a Definition for “Significant” </b> </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    There are various approaches to developing your agency’s definition of “significant.” One
    potential approach is to consider the questions below and develop criteria for what makes an
    evaluation “significant.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Does the evaluation help to answer a priority question in the learning agenda? “
    </span></b> “Significant” evaluations do not have to address learning agenda priorities, but your agency might want to
      highlight evaluations that will provide evidence to answer these important questions.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Does the evaluation focus on an agency strategic priority? </span></b>
    For example, agency leadership
    may have funded a new, high-priority program to address an emerging issue
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Does the evaluation address important Administration priorities or a congressional mandate? </span></b>
    Agencies may be mandated to conduct evaluations as a result of a reauthorization or because a
    new program has generated public interest. Congress or the Administration may also simply
    express interest in evaluating specific topics. These evaluations are not required to be listed on
    the Annual Evaluation Plan, but agencies can decide to factor this into their selection criteria.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Does the evaluation focus on one of your agency’s largest or highest-profile programs or
    initiatives? </span></b>
    Programs in which your agency has invested significant resources or programs that
    are highly visible or innovative may merit stronger consideration.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Will your agency need to make an especially consequential decision about a program, policy,
    or regulatory decision?</span></b>
    Consider whether this evaluation could enable your agency to bring
    evidence to this decision.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Will this evaluation bring new information to a program or policy that currently has very little
    evidence?</span></b>
    Consider the time that has elapsed since the program was last evaluated.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Will this evaluation pioneer an important new approach to evaluation?</span></b>
    For example, the
    evaluation could have broader implications on the field of evaluation techniques (e.g., a new
    way of merging or analyzing agency administrative data).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Will the evaluation help to significantly advance knowledge in the field?</span></b>
    This might be informed with input from external researchers and partners.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Stakeholder engagement might be beneficial when defining what “significant” means to your
    agency. The Evaluation Officer (EO) could seek feedback from agency leadership, staff from
    programs or offices, and/or a subset of stakeholders from sub-agencies and bureaus. See
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/annualinfo#2"><b>Section 2: Engaging Stakeholders</b></a> for more ideas about engaging stakeholders in the
    development of the agency’s definition of “significant”.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    A rubric can be a useful tool to facilitate conversations when selecting evaluations for the
    Annual Evaluation Plan based on your agency’s criteria. For an example rubric, see <span style="color: orange;"><b>Worksheet
    #1</b></span> of the Annual Evaluation Plan Workbook.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"> <b> Sample Classification of “Significant” and Non-“Significant” Evaluations </b> </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    The following example illustrates how an agency might choose to define “significant”
    evaluations and apply that definition to determine which of its evaluations to include on its
    Annual Evaluation Plan.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    The fictitious Department of Rural Affairs considers an evaluation “significant” if it meets any of
    these criteria:
  </p>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li> Criteria A: Addresses question(s) on the agency’s learning agenda</li>
    <li> Criteria B: Critical to the agency’s mission</li>
    <li> Criteria C: Targets a program or initiative that involves significant agency resources</li>
    <li> Criteria D: Congressionally mandated</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    The Department determined that two evaluations met its definition of “significant” according
    to these criteria. One evaluation—though important to the agency—did not meet the agency’s
    definition of “significant.” This was a judgment by agency staff who did not believe that this
    evaluation needed to be highlighted in the Annual Evaluation Plan.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <i>Note:</i> This example is illustrative only. Other agencies could make different but equally
    defensible decisions about the criteria and how to apply them to evaluations.
