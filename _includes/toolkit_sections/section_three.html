  <h2 class="heading"> Frequent stakeholder engagement is critical to the success of a learning agenda. Who
    are the most important stakeholders to your agency? How will you engage them?
  </h2>
  <div class="heading_content_wrapper">
    <div style="text-align: left; padding-right: 10px;">
      Stakeholders are individuals, groups, or
      organizations who will contribute to or benefit
      from the development of your agency’s learning
      agenda. It is critical to identify and engage a
      variety of stakeholders early in the learning
      agenda process. By collaborating with individuals
      both internal and external to the agency, you can
      ensure that your learning agenda will cover a
      diverse set of priorities and perspectives.
      Stakeholders can help the Evaluation Officer (EO) and related staff understand what is
      already known and where there are knowledge gaps. They bring in-depth knowledge of
      current research, programmatic needs, and other existing evidence. Most importantly,
      stakeholders – especially senior leadership – can make learning agenda
      implementation a whole agency effort. The EO and related staff will benefit from a wide
      support network to operationalize evidence-building activities in a way that is directly
      relevant to agency functions.

    <div class="side-panel" style="width: 4000px;">
      <p><b>OMB M-19-23 Reference</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The purpose of stakeholder engagement
        is to make sure that the learning agenda
        addresses questions that are relevant,
        salient, and meaningful to those with
        direct interests in the agency’s functions,
        and that the learning that results
        resonates with stakeholders.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p style="text-align: left;"> One way to frame your thinking around stakeholders is to categorize them broadly into
three types: internal, external (governmental), and external (nongovernmental).2 This
framework can be useful in determining the different forms of outreach and engagement
needed to gather timely and relevant feedback. All three groups can offer important
insights into the current state of evidence, knowledge gaps, and unmet needs. In the
table below, <b><span style='color:#03CAB9'>stakeholders in green </span></b>are required per the Foundations for EvidenceBased Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act, Sec. 312.C 5 USC 312. Agency
evidence-building plan). The stakeholders in black should be consulted per <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/M-19-23.pdf">OMB M-19-23</a>. </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Internal Stakeholders</b></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">When identifying internal stakeholders, it may be helpful to focus on utilization – in other
  words, who will utilize the evidence that comes out of the learning agenda? Utilization
  can exist in multiple dimensions, such as programs (who could prioritize certain
  interventions over others based on evidence?) policies, or regulations (who could act on
  a body of evidence to make policy or regulatory decisions?). Think about the staff in
  your agency who have the opportunity to make evidence-based decisions. </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"> Internal stakeholders may include senior leadership and Evidence Act officials (Chief
    Data Officer and Statistical Official) or other officials (Performance Improvement Officer,
    Chief Risk Officer, Program Management Improvement Officer, or leaders in regulations
    or privacy and information law). Consider meeting with these individuals early in the
    process to understand their desired roles and expectations. For example, senior
    leadership may request to make the final decisions on which priority questions are
    included in the published learning agenda. </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"> Also consider the subject matter expertise that exists within your agency. Keep in mind
    that agency staff will have varying degrees of capacity and time. When creating meeting
    agendas in <span style="color: orange;"> Worksheet #2</span> of the Learning Agenda Workbook (available for download in
    the tab to the right), consider dedicating time to discuss expectations for their
    involvement. </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>External Stakeholders (Governmental)</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">When identifying external government stakeholders, consider asking two questions.
      First, where are there overlaps in your agency’s mission at the local, state, and Federal
      levels? Coordination with agencies performing similar functions may increase the
      evidence base and could lead to opportunities for evidence-building partnerships.
      Second, where are there existing supports and expertise in evidence building and use
      across the federal government? You could engage experienced EOs for mentorship,
      request support or advice from OMB or the General Services Administration (GSA), or
      invite leaders in the field to speak at an agency event.  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>External Stakeholders (Nongovernmental) </b></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">Your internal stakeholder network described above may have existing relationships and
    communication channels with relevant nongovernmental stakeholders (e.g., academic
    institutions, the public, non-profits, consumer groups, advocacy groups, or grantee
    organizations). By engaging with a variety of external, nongovernmental stakeholders,
    your agency can signal that it values broad feedback and participation in its evidencebuilding activities.  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">When identifying external nongovernmental stakeholders, consider those who can offer
    diverse perspectives, knowledge, and experiences on issues relevant to your agency’s
    mission and operations. External stakeholders can help identify knowledge gaps,
    assumptions, and risks while also raising potential priority questions relevant to your
    agency’s operating environment. Through external stakeholder engagement, your
    agency can document unanswered research questions in the field and discover new
    data or analytical tools to help answer priority questions.  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Learning Agenda Core Team </b></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">If the learning agenda core team cannot be adequately staffed with in-house resources,
    you can use other resources such as contractor support, Intergovernmental Personnel
    Act (IPA) agreements, or detailees from experienced Federal agencies. In <span style="color: orange;">Worksheet 1</span>
    of the Learning Agenda Workbook document the core team and their roles and
    responsibilities in <span style="color: orange;">Table 1.</span></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">Consider inviting an agency leadership champion to join core team meetings.
    Leadership input is required in developing the learning agenda (see <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#4"><b> Section 4:
    Encouraging Leadership Buy-In).</b></a> A champion can offer ongoing feedback and may
    be able to make decisions outside of the team’s authority. </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">One alternative to forming a new team is to expand the scope of an existing group to
    include learning agenda development. For example, many agencies develop crossfunctional strategic planning working groups with diverse representation from subagencies. A subset of this group could be used to form a core team, or the group itself
    could develop or contribute to the learning agenda.  </p>
    <div class="blue_div">
      <p style="text-align: center;"> <b>How the United States Agency for International Development
        Forms a Learning Agenda Technical Team</b></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">At USAID, a well-rounded team is comprised of the following skills. Due to resource
        constraints, individuals may span multiple roles. </p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
          <li> <b>Project management:</b> The learning agenda process requires a leader to plan,
          design, execute, and monitor the necessary meetings and follow-up activities. A
          project manager can engage with agency leadership for support and guidance, and
          monitor implementation to ensure objectives are being met. This individual should
          also ensure that the process is aligned to the agency’s strategic planning,
          performance management, and budgeting cycles. </li>
          <li> <b>Learning-focused meeting facilitation: </b> The learning agenda process will include
          many meetings with internal and external stakeholders, including senior leadership.
          A facilitator will stimulate conversation, leverage learning opportunities, and
          encourage participation from diverse stakeholders. </li>
          <li> <b>Methodological and analytical skills:</b> Learning agenda questions must be
          answerable. Individuals with methodological and analytical skills will provide valuable
          input as to the feasibility and cost of answering proposed questions.  </li>
          <li> <b>Subject matter expertise: </b> The team should include individuals who can assist with
          identifying evidence and learning needs, and who understand how the answers to
          learning agenda questions will be used. Agencies are strongly encouraged to involve
          program staff who will use evidence in daily operations. </li>
          <li> <b> Organizational learning and knowledge management skills: </b> To promote
          utilization, identify team members who understand and represent the needs,
          expectations and constraints of end users. These individuals can identify
          opportunities or entry points to integrate learning products in the agency’s work.
          Individuals with organizational learning and knowledge management skills will advise
          on how learning products can be user friendly, timely, and shared with the right
          audience.</li>
          <li> <b>Communication skills:</b> Throughout the stakeholder engagement process, it is
          important to utilize a communications professional who crafts clear and consistent
          messaging that supports internalization of evidence generated from the learning
          agenda. This individual may also play a role in designing the action plan to
          disseminate and use evidence generated from the learning products. </li>
        </ul>

    <p style="text-align: left;">If you form a learning agenda core team, meet with the team to complete <span style="color: orange;"><b>Activity 1</b></span> in
      the Learning Agenda Workbook. The activity will help your team fill out the stakeholder
      matrix in <span style="color: orange;"><b>Table 2.</b></span> If you do not have a core team, consider using the guidance below to
      complete <span style="color: orange;"><b>Table 2</b></span> to the best of your knowledge.  </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>An Overview of Stakeholder Engagement Activities</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">There is no universal approach to stakeholder engagement – the methods will vary by
      stakeholder group and the agency’s needs, resources, and structure. The type of
      activity should also take into consideration the information you are trying to gather from
      the stakeholder group (e.g., recommendations for priority questions, or sharing questions for feedback to ensure that they resonate with stakeholders). Consider some
      examples below, keeping in mind that the Paperwork Reduction Act could apply to your
      information collection method: </p>
      <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li> Surveys</li>
        <li> Email campaign </li>
        <li> Webinars</li>
        <li>Individual interviews </li>
        <li>Requests for public comment </li>
        <li>Conferences </li>
        <li>Roundtables </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align: left;">In <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#5"><b>Section 5: Developing a Learning Agenda,</b></a> the EO and related staff will design the
        learning agenda process. This includes when and how to engage stakeholders to get

        content, <span style="color: orange;"><b>Worksheet 2</b></span> of the Learning Agenda Workbook includes sample meeting
        outcomes, discussion topics, and tips for consideration. Reference <span style="color: orange;"><b>Worksheet 2</b></span>

      <p style="text-align: left;">As noted above, senior leadership and program managers are very important
        stakeholders in the learning agenda process. The following sample meeting agendas
        include questions you could ask senior leadership or program managers during an initial
        meeting about your agency’s learning agenda. The EO and related staff could also
