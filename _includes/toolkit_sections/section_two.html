      An agency’s learning agenda will include priority
      questions that span a period of no less than four
      years (although it should be revisited at least
      annually and updated as needed). This section
      provides tips on how to determine what a “priority
      question” is for your agency and how to structure
      the questions to be answerable, useful, and
      result in actionable information. Additionally, this
      section provides examples of various questions
      that an agency may include in its learning
      agenda.

  <h2 style="text-align: left;"> <b> Overview of Priority Questions </b> </h2>
  <p style="text-align: left;"> An agency learning agenda includes priority questions relevant to programs, policies,
    and regulations. What is a priority question? These are questions that, when answered,
    have the biggest impact on your agency’s functioning and performance. How many
    questions meet the criteria of “biggest impact” is up to your agency, and the number of
    questions may be influenced by agency size or capacity. </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"> Stakeholder engagement is required to develop the learning agenda per the Evidence
    Act. Stakeholders can offer valuable input on potential priority questions that will have
    the biggest impact on agency functioning and performance. This toolkit offers strategies
    for identifying stakeholders <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#3"><b>(Section 3: Engaging Stakeholders)</b></a>, consulting leadership

  <p style="text-align: left; color: #2E9AC4">Where appropriate, start with an overarching question and develop specific,
    answerable questions.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Useful learning agenda questions do not need to be narrow in
    scope. However, a question may be too broad to be answerable. Below is an example
    of an overarching question from a fictitious Department of Societal Betterment, whose
    agency mission is to reduce societal nuisances. The question is followed by series of
    sub-questions that are specific and answerable: </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li> <i> Overarching question:</i> “How can we reduce public nuisances?” This question
        could be included in a learning agenda, but it does not specify which of the many
        types of nuisances will be the focus for learning. </li>
      <li> <i>Specific and answerable questions:</i> The level of specificity can vary for an
        answerable question. For example, the following three questions may all be
        considered answerable for the Department of Societal Betterment. The first looks

        possible to write a description of evidence-building activities that will answer each
        question. </li>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li> <i> Has the policy setting a $300 fine for littering led to an increase or
              decrease in littering in the last 10 years? </i></li>
            <li> <i>Does new signage emphasizing pride in our public places reduce the
              incidence of littering? </i></li>
            <li> <i> Which message on the new signage, among the three versions, is most
              effective in encouraging people not to litter? </i> </li>
          </ul>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Learning agenda questions do not need to be answerable with one study. Important
      questions often require sub-questions and multiple studies or analyses, typically
      building on each other, to create a useful and actionable body of evidence.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"><span style='color:#03CAB9'>Consider how each question could be measured.</span> Can the question be answered
      with qualitative or quantitative data? If yes, does the data exist, or does your agency
      need to plan new data collection efforts?
      Without supporting evidence, the answer
      to the question is unlikely to inform
      agency decisions.</p>
      <div class="heading_content_wrapper">
        <p> <span style='color:#03CAB9'>Include questions that draw on
        different components of evidence.</span> As
        your agency formulates questions for its
        learning agenda, think ahead about
        evidence-building activities. How could
        policy analysis, program evaluation,
        foundational fact-finding, or performance
        measurement help answer your priority
        questions? As shown to the right, these
        are the four components of evidence
        described in OMB M-19-23. See the box
        below for a subset of the Small Business
        Administration’s (SBA) learning agenda
        questions, organized by evidence type. </p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"> <b>How the Small Business Administration’s Enterprise Learning Agenda uses all Four
      Components of Evidence </b></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The SBA develops an Enterprise Learning Agenda (ELA) to empower program managers to
        achieve their priorities while fostering an environment of continuous learning. The ELA is a
        five-year plan that aligns with the Agency’s goals outlined in the FY 2018-2022 Strategic
        Plan. The ELA includes questions that cover the different components of evidence to allow
        for evidence building across a spectrum of methods. The following questions are aligned to
        the strategic goal, “Support small business revenue and job growth.” </p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
          <li> <b>Foundational fact-finding:</b> What types of jobs do SBA loans create?</li>
          <li> <b>Policy analysis:</b> What regulatory or policy improvements could be made to help
SBA programs create more jobs?</li>

    <p style="text-align: left;"> <b>Defining “Short-Term” and “Long-Term” Questions </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"> Agencies should include short-term and long-term questions in their learning agendas,
      including definitions of the timeframes (OMB M-19-23). Consider the following factors
      when defining what “short-term” and “long-term” mean for your agency:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li> <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Agency capacity: </span></b>Consider referencing your agency’s Capacity Assessment, if
        completed, to understand in-house capabilities. If a question will require
        independent, contracted evaluations, consider the length of the procurement
        process in addition to time to complete to the studies. </li>
        <li> <b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Decision-making timelines: </span></b>Evidence-building activities such as evaluations
        may require time for funding or staff resources to be allocated, even if conducted
        in-house. Consider when funding is set aside for evaluations, as well as the
        period during which the evidence will be used. For example, if your agency
        updates a specific policy every five years, the definition of “long-term” might align
        to that timeline. </li>
        <li><b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Order of operations:  </span></b> Before answering a long-term question, a series of shortterm questions may need to be answered first. When defining “long-term,”
        consider the timeline for answering consecutive short-term questions.  </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> For more information and examples of short-term and long-term questions, please refer
        to Table B.1: Example of Potential Learning Agenda Questions on page 17 of OMB M19-23. </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> <b>Sample Questions by Mission Area and Agency Function </b></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> Some agencies are primarily grant-making organizations, others are operational, and
        many function in multiple mission areas. To assist with priority question brainstorming,

        function </p>
