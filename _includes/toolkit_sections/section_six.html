  <h2 class="heading"> Internal and external stakeholders can offer insights into existing evidence-building
activities and ideas to inform an evidence-building roadmap. How do you use this
information to create a list of priority questions for your learning agenda?
  </h2>
<div class="heading_content_wrapper">
  <div style="text-align: left; padding-right: 10px;">
    <p>Depending on your approach
    to stakeholder engagement,
    your team may have an
    extensive list of survey results,
    public comments, and/or
    meeting notes with ideas and
    questions related to research,
    analysis, and evaluation. At
    this stage in the learning
    agenda process, your team
    may need a process to filter
    and synthesize stakeholder
    input to develop a set of priority
    questions.</p>
    <p>If your agency already has a
    process for developing draft
    questions, please skip to Step
    4 of this section for guidance
    and a template to present draft
    questions to senior leadership.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 5000px;">

  </div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  One possible process, as
  shown in the figure to the right,
  includes converting
  stakeholder input into
  questions, reviewing and
  refining questions, checking for balance across the questions in required and suggested
  categories, and presenting the questions to leadership. This process can be tailored to
  the structure of your core team <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#3""><b> (Section 3: Engaging Stakeholders)</b></a>, requests from
  senior leadership <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#4""><b> (Section 4: Encouraging Leadership Buy-In)</b></a>, and agency needs.
  Please refer to <span style="color: orange;"><b>Worksheet #4</b></span> of the Learning Agenda Workb
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  f your agency opts to have sub-agency learning agendas, this process can be used to
  determine which sub-agency learning agenda questions will be included in the agencywide learning agenda. Please note that sub-agency learning agendas cannot fulfill the
  requirement for an agency-wide learning agenda. See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#4"">Office of Evaluation Sciences
  Toolkit Landing Page</a> to download additional information about sub-agency learning
  agendas.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Convert Stakeholder Input into Questions  </b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  In <span style="color: orange;"><b>Worksheet #3</b></span> of the Learning Agenda Workbook, the Evaluation Officer (EO) and
  related staff documented stakeholder engagement activities to receive input on potential
  learning agenda content. No matter how your team chose to engage with internal and
  external stakeholders – whether it was listening sessions, roundtables, email outreach,
  internal meetings, agency-wide surveys, or conferences – the suggestions you received
  on evidence priorities may be in the form of statements. Some practitioners find it useful
  to convert statements into questions before reviewing them. They also recommend
  separating multi-part questions and removing duplicative input. For examples of priority
questions, refer to <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#4""><b>Section 2: Types of Learning Questions.</b></a>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  If you formed a core team (see <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#4""><b>Section 3: Engaging Stakeholders</b></a>), you may be
  interested in additional guidance about how to operationalize the question review
  process for this team. The process below, and guidance in <span style="color: orange;"><b>Activity #2</b></span> of the Learning
  Agenda Workbook can be used to form questions that are relevant and meaningful to
  your agency’s strategy and operations. To follow along with <span style="color: orange;"><b>Activity #2</b></span> of the Learning
  Agenda Workbook and the steps below, download the Excel Workbook in the tab to the
  right.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>1. Create a Rubric and Vet Questions</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  What makes a good question for your agency? In <span style="color: orange;"><b>Table 5</b></span> in <span style="color: orange;"><b>Worksheet #4</b></span> of the
  Learning Agenda Workbook, your team can use suggested criteria or create your own
  criteria to evaluate potential priority questions. Rigorous criteria help ensure that the
  answer to each question will be used to inform strategic or operational decisions.
  Setting criteria can help facilitate conversations around what constitutes a good
  question and what questions are priorities for your agency and leadership. The criteria
  used by the United States Agency for International Development, as described in the
  box below, may be a useful reference.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  After determining the criteria that are best suited for your agency, you can use <span style="color: orange;"><b>Table 6</b></span>
  to score each question and determine whether or not a question should be refined.
  During this process, stakeholder consultation may be necessary. For example, when
  evaluating whether a question is “inclusive,” program managers may need to be
  consulted.

<div class="blue_div">
  <p style="text-align: center;"> <b>A Tool for Developing Learning Questions
from the United States Agency for International Development </b></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    This <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#4"><b>checklist</b></a>, summarized below, is used by USAID and its implementing partners when
    developing or reviewing learning questions during monitoring, evaluation, and learning
    processes
  </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li> <b>Useful:</b> Each question should have clear use or applicability to your agency’s work.
      When determining whether a question is actionable, keep in mind policy
      considerations, including earmarked funds and agency mandates.</li>
      <li> <b>Focused:</b> Confirm that the question can be understood similarly by multiple people.
      Define key terms that could have multiple meanings or interpretations. Perform due
      diligence to make sure the question is still unanswered.</li>
      <li> <b>Feasible:</b> Given the scope of the question, consider whether there are appropriate
      quantitative and qualitative methods that can be used to answer it, and whether those
      methods will be considered valid and credible by the users of the learning. Determine
      the level of effort required and whether the resources required outweighs the
      anticipated benefits of answering the question. </li>
      <li> <b>Inclusive:</b> For every question asked, there are individuals responsible for carrying out
      the learning activities to answer the question, and those who we hope will use the
      answers to inform their work. Collaborate with those stakeholder groups to increase
      the likelihood that answers to learning questions will be used to adapt and improve
      programming.</li>
    </ul>

<p style="text-align: left;"><b>2. Assess Alignment with Strategic Goals and OMB M-19-23 Guidance</b></p>
<div class="heading_content_wrapper">
  <div style="text-align: left; padding-right: 10px;">
    Now that you have a set of organized,
    potential priority questions, consider whether
    the portfolio of questions align to leadership
    priorities, Foundations for Evidence-Based
    Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act)
    requirements, and OMB M-19-23 suggestions.
    As a reminder, the priority questions should
    reflect a mix of both mission-strategic and
    agency-operational questions, as well as
    short-term and long-term questions. Agencies
    have discretion to create a balance of
    questions appropriate for their unique needs.
    Below is a list of potential questions to
    consider when assessing appropriateness of balance using <span style="color: orange;"><b>Table 7.</b></span>
  </div>
  <div class="side-panel">
    <p><b>OMB M-19-23 Reference</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Agencies should identify priority
    questions that, when answered, will
    have the biggest impact on agency
    functioning and performance…
    Learning agendas should include
    both short- and long-term questions
    of interest to the agency, as well as
    mission-strategic and agencyoperational questions… in a balance
    that emphasize those of greatest
    relevance and priority to the agency.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<ol type="a">
  <li style="text-align: left;"><b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>Is each strategic goal supported by at least one question?</span></b>
    <p>Agencies are not required to, but may align each priority question to a strategic
    goal. However, agencies are required to list which strategic goals are addressed
    by the plan.</p></li>
    <li style="text-align: left;"><b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>
      Do questions support Secretarial or other senior leadership priorities?</span></b>
      <p>Senior leadership are critical stakeholders in learning agenda development. If
      their priorities are reflected in the set of questions, leadership is more likely to
      champion the learning agenda.</p></li>
    <li style="text-align: left;"><b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>
      Do questions overlap with key external stakeholder priorities?</span></b>
      <p>An agency may need external support to answer a priority question in the next
      four years. Consider which of the field’s priorities align with agency priorities and
      where overlap may exist to support the group of questions. </p></li>
    <li style="text-align: left;"><b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>
      Do questions appropriately span sub-agencies?</span></b>
      <p>If there are no questions related to a specific sub-agency, consider revisiting your
      stakeholder engagement notes or process, as appropriate.</p></li>
    <li style="text-align: left;"><b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>
      Do questions appropriately span geographic regions covered by our
      agency?</span></b>
      <p>In the stakeholder engagement process, you may have received feedback from
      regional offices. Consider how your learning questions reflect the priorities by
      geographic region.</p></li>
    <li style="text-align: left;"><b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>
      Do questions reflect consideration of the four components of evidence
      noted in OMB M-19-23 (i.e., performance measurement, policy analysis,
      program evaluation, and foundational fact-finding)?</span></b>
      <p>During the stakeholder engagement process, you may have documented a
      variety of evidence-building activities in your agency. Consider how diverse
      learning activities can help answer priority questions.</p></li>
    <li style="text-align: left;"><b><span style='color:#2E9AC4'>
      If referencing the Capacity Assessment, do the questions align to the areas
      of evidence your agency is trying to build capacity in?</span></b>
      <p>Agencies are not required to align the Capacity Assessment and learning
      agenda. However, if your Capacity Assessment is complete, the EO may have
      identified specific focus areas for evidence building, such as a program with
      limited evidence-building activities. Consider how your priority questions will
      generate evidence to support those focus areas. </p></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>3. Categorize Questions</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  Priority questions are not required to be categorized, but categorization has several
  benefits. First, the EO and related staff can quickly review sets of potential questions to
  see where additional questions may be needed (e.g., aligned to a specific strategic
  goal). Also, the learning agenda is a coordination tool. If questions are categorized,
  owners could be assigned to a portfolio of similar questions for tracking or accountability
  purposes for implementation. Lastly, the learning agenda will be shared publicly with
  stakeholders who will be involved in implementation. Easily understood categories helps
  stakeholders clearly recognize your agency’s priorities for learning.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  There are a variety of methods to categorize your potential priority questions. For
  example, questions could be mapped to strategic goals, organized by focus areas, or
  divided by question type. You may find it useful to start by categorizing long-term
  questions, then deliberate whether a series of short-term questions should be answered
  first.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  As you and your team organize questions, look for crosscutting themes and potential
  projects. In the leadership presentation template, there is space to include proposed
  learning activities with the priority questions.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>4. Obtain Leadership Approval</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  As described in <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/learninginfo#4"><b>Section 4: Encouraging Leadership Buy-In</b></a>, leadership input and
  buy-in is critical to the learning agenda process. You may have initiated leadership
  engagement with a briefing on Evidence Act requirements and documented their needs
  and priorities. At this stage, a meeting with leadership is an opportunity to show how the
  set of potential questions is aligned to expectations communicated at the beginning of
  the process.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  Reference your stakeholder engagement matrix for leaders identified for final review
  and approval of learning questions. Depending on the number of questions to be
  discussed and individuals attending, time allocated for this meeting may be one to four
  hours. Consider designating an individual with strong facilitation skills to lead the
  meeting for a focused discussion that leads to consensus on the priority questions.
