Julie Nygard comes to us from the USDA Forest Service where she works as the Organizational Performance Management Chief in the Forest Service budget office.  In her role, Julie is involved in all aspects of performance management including strategic planning, performance measures and reporting, communications, budget development, and stakeholder engagement. Most recently, Julie and her branch have become the central hub for standing up an enterprise analytics capacity for the Forest Service.  Julie has more than ten years experience in related positions. She spent nine years at the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in various positions at the program and line office (NOAA Fisheries) level focused on outyear budget planning, performance and strategic planning. Julie gets excited when involved in projects or initiatives that focus on how an agency, or program, can take practical steps to solve problems and know if they are delivering solutions efficiently and effectively. Professionally, she is interested in expanding her knowledge and use of human-centered design techniques to help problem solving; and establishing clear, strong governance structures that help organizations achieve their goals. Outside of work, Julie spends time with her two daughters, loves reading books, and walking or dining out with friends.
