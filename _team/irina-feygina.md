Irina Feygina, Ph.D., is a social psychologist who specializes in climate communication and the behavioral aspects of policy and program development and implementation in domains of energy efficiency, clean technology adoption, environmental protection, sustainability, and climate change assessment and adaptation. She is the Director of Behavioral Science and Assessment at Climate Central, where she works on issues of science skepticism, climate attribution, and the use of social media in engaging the public and decision makers in recognizing and responding to climate change. Previously she served as OES Fellow, where she applied insights from behavioral science to improve program implementation across the federal government, and as a AAAS Congressional Fellow with Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO), working on the energy and environment portfolios. She completed her doctorate at New York University, where her research focused on the role of motivated reasoning in climate change skepticism. In her work, Irina emphasizes incorporation of human needs and behavioral approaches into program design, communication strategies, and evidence-based policy and decision making.
