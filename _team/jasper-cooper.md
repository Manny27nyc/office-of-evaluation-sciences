Jasper Cooper is a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at Princeton University's Kahneman-Treisman Center for Behavioral Science & Public Policy. His work at OES primarily focuses on projects to understand barriers to cooperation with government. His research interests include the behavioral science of survey non-response, innovations to improve uptake of core government services by members of marginalized populations, and improving citizen-government interactions in the domain of the justice sector. Prior to joining Princeton, Jasper was a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University, where he conducted several large-scale field experiments on justice sector reform and cooperation with state authorities in Papua New Guinea and Uganda.
