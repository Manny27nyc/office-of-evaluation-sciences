**Discipline:**

**What is your favorite DC area spot?**

The National Arboretum

**Why did you join OES?**

I feel very connected to OES's goal of making government work better for people, and I'm excited to contribute to that goal. 

**What's one of the most exciting things you've worked on at OES?**

I feel lucky to be involved in OES's support of federal agencies' efforts to build a culture of learning and evidence under the new Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, as I believe that this will help agencies build evidence and best practices into all levels of their programming and decision-making.
