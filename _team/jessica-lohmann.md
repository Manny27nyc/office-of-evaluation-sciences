**Discipline:** 

Program Evaluation, Public Policy 

**What is your favorite DC area spot?**

Capital One Arena 

**Why did you join OES?**

I joined OES to work with a highly skilled office that has a track record of success as they expand their capacity to provide government-wide resources and implementation support around evidence-building activities and evaluation, in support of the Evidence Act. 

**What's one of the most exciting things you've worked on at OES?**

One of the things I am most proud of during my time at OES was working on the Evidence Act Toolkits. I believe we are coming into a new era in the federal government where the use of evidence in decision making is no longer a "nice-to-have" but is instead a requirement that will help drive better decisions. I have enjoyed working on a project to provide a resource for federal agencies as they work to implement this important legislation.
