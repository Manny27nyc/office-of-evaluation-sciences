Nicholas Wilson is an Associate Professor of Economics at Reed College. His research focuses on fundamental puzzles about human behavior in the context of health and development economics. These include, “how do individuals respond to improvements in health technology?” and “why do individuals invest so little in preventive health inputs?”. The majority of his research projects are randomized controlled experiments or quasi-experimental projects using geo-spatial data. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the University of Chicago Population Center, and the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) have funded his work. Prior to joining Reed College, he was a Visiting Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley and an Assistant Professor of Economics at Williams College. He received his Ph.D. in Economics from Brown University, a MA in Economics from Brown University, a MPA in International Development from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and a BA in Economics from Reed College. He has also worked as a consultant for UNAIDS, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, and the World Bank.
