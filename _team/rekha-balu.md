Rock Creek Park

**Why did you join OES?**

To serve in government, to test innovative interventions at scale, to learn from the best!

**What's one of the most exciting things you've worked on at OES?**

Designing within constraints -- we rarely have all the time, data, or intervention components we'd ideally like, so how do you make smart tradeoffs that still improve people's experience of government?
