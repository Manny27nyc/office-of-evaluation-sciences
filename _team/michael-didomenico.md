**Discipline:**

Public Policy

**What is your favorite DC area spot?**

Rock Creek Park is the best place to be immersed in nature only steps away from everything else in the city. Hands down the best back yard you could have.

**Why did you join OES?**

I liked the idea of being nimble. Rapid cycle evaluations allow you to learn as you go, and you can see improvements much more readily than some of the longer-term evaluations I worked on previously.  

**What's one of the most exciting things you've worked on at OES?**

Helping to evaluate HUD's Project SOAR demonstration has been the most challenging and interesting project. The project evaluates the effectiveness of using college navigators to increase access to post-secondary education for young people living in public housing. It constantly challenges me to think about what we can and cannot learn by relying mostly on administrative data to understand an entirely new program with local variation.
