Mary Clair Turner is a Research Fellow at the University of Chicagoâ€™s Urban Labs and a Doctoral Candidate in Human Development and Social Policy at Northwestern University.   Her research uses econometric and mixed methods techniques to examine how interventions that target the development of psychological skills or access to social resources impact decision making, particularly during educational transitions such as the transition from high school to college.  She draws on insights from human development to focus on sensitive periods of development when interventions may induce the largest effects.  She currently helps lead an impact evaluation of a soccer-based nutrition and character development program for elementary school students in Chicago.  Before graduate school, Mary Clair was a Technical Research Assistant at MDRC in the Young Adult and Postsecondary Education group where she helped conduct large-scale randomized control trials of interventions in community colleges.  She holds a BA in Math from Washington and Lee University and an MA in Human Development and Social Policy from Northwestern University.
