Shenandoah National Park

**Why did you join OES?**

I get excited identifying important questions with government agencies, and connecting them to academics who can help answer those questions.

**What's one of the most exciting things you've worked on at OES?**

I was really proud when the VA learned from working with us on a project to <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/projects/va-health-care-benefits/">connect separating servicemembers to VA health benefits.</a> After our project launched, the VA ran a similar test with phone calls to separating servicemembers -- and they randomized the phone calls!
