**Why did you join OES?**

For me, joining OES was an opportunity to learn more about evaluation in the federal government, work with experts in a variety of fields, and get exposure to projects related to promoting the health of Americans. 

**What's one of the most exciting things you've worked on at OES?**

In addition to planning the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/annualevent/">2019 annual event</a>, I have had the chance to work on an exciting project aimed at reducing concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine prescribing in the context of the National Capital Region Military Health System.
