Anne Herlache is an analyst with the Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics division of the Internal Revenue Service. At the IRS, her projects focus on applying behavioral insights to tax compliance issues. Beyond that, she is part of a small team coordinating internal and international collaborative communities that apply behavioral insights to tax administration. Her work at OES draws on behavioral science to inform projects on decreasing non-response bias in large-scale surveys, reducing error rates in submitted forms, and increasing cost effectiveness government operations. In 2017, she received a PhD in social psychology from Iowa State University and was selected as a Presidential Management Fellow. Anneâ€™s version of work-life balance involves reserving ample time for hiking, regardless of weather conditions.
